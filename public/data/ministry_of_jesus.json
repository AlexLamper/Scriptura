    "title": "Introduction",
    "content": "Four Gospels. Four testimonies to the life and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ. Four different authors recounting various details as inspired by the Holy Spirit. Four different intended audiences to whom they originally wrote. And yet there is just one message conveyed by all four: God loves you and He sent His only Son to redeem you and give you life to the fullest!\n\nIn the pages that follow I have forensically analyzed the four Gospels and interwoven their unique details of each passage into one cohesive account. Additionally, I have ordered[1] these accounts into an accurate timeline so you can read these events as they occurred. Faithfulness to the English Standard Version (ESV) text was maintained in the interweaving process. Nothing has been added to the Gospel texts, and nothing has been removed.\n\nThis book is formatted to be read and enjoyed as a non-fiction novel or daily devotional, but even Bible study will be revolutionized by these readings! Each account begins with the corresponding Scripture references from which the account was derived to provide easy access to each Gospel writers details, and footnotes are provided as needed.\n\nMy hope is that the life and ministry of Jesus as presented in this book will forever change how you read the Gospels. I can guarantee that you have never read these familiar passages like this before! And my prayer is that as your knowledge of Him increases, so also your love for Him will even more so increase, and that you might comprehend the unimaginable love that God has for you!\n\nR. D. Meyers\n\n[1] Many have attempted to harmonize the Gospels, with the first such attempts beginning in the second century. Everyone seems to agree on a chronology for 80% of the Gospel events, while no one agrees on the remaining 20% that encompass the six months between the Feast of Tabernacles and Jesus&apos; Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem. I do not claim to have figured it out when there have been so many great theologians who neither agree with me, nor with each other! However, there are some clues in these events which help in placing them in an order that makes sense, and in the end, their actual order is of little consequence since the truth of the Gospel teachings themselves stand on their own."

    "title": "John the Baptist Prepares the Way",
    "content": "Matthew 3:1-12; Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-17\n\nThe beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the Baptist the son of Zechariah in the wilderness of Judea. In those days John went into all the region around the Jordan, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way. The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough places shall become level ways, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\n\nNow John wore a garment of camel&apos;s hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. And all Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\n\nBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father, for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n\nAnd the crowds asked him, What then shall we do? And he answered them, Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise. Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?And he said to them, Collect no more than you are authorized to do. Soldiers also asked him, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.\n\nAs the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Christ, John answered them all, saying, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is mightier than I is coming, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn, but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire."

John would have prevented Him, saying, I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me? But Jesus answered him, Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he consented.\n\nAnd when Jesus was baptized and was praying, immediately He went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were torn open to Him, and He saw the Holy Spirit of God descending on Him in bodily form, like a dove and coming to rest on Him; and behold, a voice came from heaven saying, You are my beloved Son; with You I am well pleased.\n\nJesus, when He began His ministry, was about thirty years of age."

And He was with the wild animals, and He ate nothing during those days. And after fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry. And the tempter, the devil, came and said to Him, If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread. And Jesus answered him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.\n\nThen the devil took Him to the holy city, Jerusalem, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to Him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you, and On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. And Jesus answered him, Again it is written, You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.\n\nAgain, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory in a moment of time. And he said to Him, To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will.If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours. And Jesus answered him, Be gone, Satan! For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve.\n\nAnd when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time, and behold, angels came and were ministering to Him."

    "content": "John 1:19-34\n\nAnd this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ. And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No. So they said to him, Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself? He said, I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.\n\n(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) They asked him, Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet? John answered them, I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know,even He who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie. These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n\nThe next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is He of whom I said, After me comes a man who ranks before me, because He was before me. I myself did not know Him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that He might be revealed to Israel. And John bore witness: I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on Him. I myself did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."

The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, What are you seeking? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which means Teacher), where are you staying? He said to them, Come and you will see. So they came and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter&apos;s brother. He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas (which means Peter).\n\nThe next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, Follow me. Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit! Nathanael said to Him, How do you know me? Jesus answered him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you. Nathanael answered Him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel! Jesus answered him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these. And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."

    "content": "John 2:1-12\n\nOn the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with His disciples. When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine. And Jesus said to her, Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come. His mother said to the servants, Do whatever He tells you.\n\nNow there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, Fill the jars with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And He said to them, Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast. So they took it. When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now. This, the first of His signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested His glory. And His disciples believed in Him.\n\nAfter this He went down to Capernaum, with His mother and His brothers and His disciples, and they stayed there for a few days."

And He would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And He was teaching them and saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers.\n\nAnd the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them. But when the chief priests and the scribes heard it and saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple, Hosanna to the Son of David! they were indignant, and they said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise?\n\nAnd He was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy Him, but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were astonished at His teaching, hanging on His words. And leaving them when evening came, they went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there."

    "title": "Nicodemus Visits Jesus",
    "content": "John 3:1-21\n\nNow there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him. Jesus answered him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother&apos;s womb and be born? Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again. The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\n\nNicodemus said to Him, How can these things be? Jesus answered him, Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except He who descended from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life.\n\nFor God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God."

    "content": "Matthew 4:12; Mark 1:14a; Luke 3:18-20;[3] 4:14; John 3:224:4\n\nAfter this Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, and He remained there with them and was baptizing. John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized (for John had not yet been put in prison).\n\nNow a discussion arose between some of John&apos;s disciples and a Jew over purification. And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witnesslook, He is baptizing, and all are going to Him. John answered, A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him. The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom&apos;s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete. He must increase, but I must decrease.\n\nHe who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all. He bears witness to what He has seen and heard, yet no one receives His testimony. Whoever receives His testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. For He whom God has sent utters the words of God, for He gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.\n\nSo with many other exhortations John preached good news to the people. But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother&apos;s wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done, added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison.\n\nNow when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John (although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but only His disciples), and when He heard that John had been arrested, He left Judea and departed again for Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and a report about Him went out through all the surrounding country. And He had to pass through Samaria.\n\n[3] The ministries of Jesus and of John were concurrent for about a year. Luke, not yet having told us anything about Jesus&apos; ministry, already mentions John&apos;s imprisonment! Luke&apos;s account here is not chronological, but it is logical. He wishes to bring the story of John&apos;s ministry to a close, in order to write the story of Jesus&apos; ministry."

    "title": "Jesus and the Woman of Samaria",
    "content": "John 4:5-45\n\nSo He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob&apos;s well was there; so Jesus, wearied as He was from His journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.\n\nA woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give me a drink. (For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to Him, How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water. The woman said to Him, Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock. Jesus said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.\n\nJesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here. The woman answered Him, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You are right in saying, I have no husband for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true. The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship. Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship Him. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth. The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ). When He comes, He will tell us all things. Jesus said to her, I who speak to you am He.\n\nJust then His disciples came back. They marveled that He was talking with a woman, but no one said, What do you seek? or, Why are you talking with her? So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people, Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ? They went out of the town and were coming to Him.\n\nMeanwhile the disciples were urging Him, saying, Rabbi, eat. But He said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about. So the disciples said to one another, Has anyone brought Him something to eat? Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent me and to accomplish His work. Do you not say, There are yet four months, then comes the harvest? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest. Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. For here the saying holds true, One sows and another reaps. I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.\n\nMany Samaritans from that town believed in Him because of the woman&apos;s testimony, He told me all that I ever did. So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed there two days. And many more believed because of His word. They said to the woman, It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.\n\nAfter the two days He departed for Galilee. (For Jesus Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.) So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him, having seen all that He had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast."

When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to Him and asked Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. So Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe. The official said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies. Jesus said to him, Go; your son will live. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way. As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering. So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, Your son will live. And he himself believed, and all his household. This was now the second sign that Jesus did when He had come from Judea to Galilee."

And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.\n\nAnd He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as was His custom, He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and He stood up to read. And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to Him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord&apos;s favor. And He rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him. And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing. And all spoke well of Him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from His mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph&apos;s son? And He said to them, Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself. What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well. And He said, Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land, and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian. When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. And they rose up and drove Him out of the town and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw Him down the cliff. But passing through their midst, He went away.\n\nAnd leaving Nazareth He went down and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentilesthe people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned."

And great crowds followed Him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.\n\n[4] Luke 4:42 reveals that these events took place the morning after the previous events recorded in Luke 4:38-41."

    "title": "A Miraculous Catch",
    "content": "Luke 5:1-11[5]\n\nOn one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on Him to hear the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret, and He saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon&apos;s, He asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the people from the boat. And when He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch. And Simon answered, Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets. And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking. They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus&apos; knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men. And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.\n\n[5] Most harmonies see this event in Luke 5:1-11 as the same one recorded in Matthew 4:18-22 and Mark 1:16-20, but the details are so completely different that it must be treated as a separate event. Jesus calling His disciples multiple times should not surprise us as many of our own personal testimonies would demonstrate that Jesus called us multiple times before we finally left everything and followed Him. In fact, after the crucifixion Peter returns once again to fishing, and Jesus once again gives the call to follow Him in John 21:19, 22!"

And when he saw Jesus, he knelt before Him, fell on his face, imploring Him and begged Him, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean. And Jesus, moved with pity, stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, I will; be clean. And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. And Jesus sternly charged him, See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them. But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that now even more the report about Him went abroad. Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and great crowds gathered to Him from every quarter to hear Him and to be healed of their infirmities. But He would withdraw to desolate places and pray."

On one of those days, as He was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Him to heal. And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And He was preaching the word to them. And behold, four men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus, but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof above Him, and when they had made an opening, they let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus. And when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven. And behold, some of the scribes and the Pharisees were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone? And immediately Jesus, perceiving in His spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, Why do you think evil and question these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise, take up your bed and walk? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sinsthen He said to the paralyticI say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home. And immediately he rose up before them all and picked up his bed he had been lying on and went home, glorifying God. When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men, saying, We never saw anything like this! And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, We have seen extraordinary things today."

And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and His disciples, for there were many who followed Him. And when the Pharisees and their scribes saw that He was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they grumbled at His disciples, Why do you and your teacher eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?

And Jesus said to them, Can you make wedding guests mourn and fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days. He also told them a parable: No one tears a piece of unshrunk cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from the garment, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made, and the piece from the new will not match the old. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.

And seeing Him, he knelt before Him and fell at His feet and implored Him earnestly to come to his house, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live. For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. And Jesus rose and followed him, with His disciples.\n\nAs Jesus went with him, a great crowd followed Him and thronged about Him and pressed around Him. And behold, there was a woman who had had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her living that she had on physicians, she was no better but rather grew worse and could not be healed by anyone. She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind Him in the crowd and touched the fringe of His garment. For she said to herself, If I only touch His garment, I will be made well. And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus, perceiving in Himself that power had gone out from Him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, Who was it that touched my garments? When all denied it, Peter and His disciples said, Master, you see the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you, and yet you say, Who touched me? But Jesus said, Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out from me. And He looked around to see who had done it. But when the woman, knowing what had happened to her, saw that she was not hidden, she came in fear and trembling, and falling down before Him declared in the presence of all the people the whole truth why she had touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed. Jesus turned, and seeing her He said, Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.\n\nWhile He was still speaking, there came from the ruler&apos;s house some who said, Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further? But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not fear, only believe, and she will be well. And when Jesus came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, He allowed no one to enter with Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James, and the father and mother of the child. And Jesus saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly for her. And when He had entered, He said to them, Why are you making a commotion and weeping? Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping. And they laughed at Him, knowing that she was dead. But He put them all outside and took the child&apos;s father and mother and those who were with Him and went in where the child was. Taking her by the hand He said to her, Talitha cumi, which means, Little girl, I say to you, arise. And immediately her spirit returned, and the girl got up at once and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and her parents were immediately overcome with amazement. And He strictly charged them to tell no one what had happened, and He directed them to give her something to eat. And the report of this went through all that district.\n\n[6] Matthew 9:18 reveals that these events took place directly after the previous events recorded in Matthew 9:14-17."

    "content": "John 5:1-47\n\nAfter this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.\n\nNow there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades. In these lay a multitude of invalidsblind, lame, and paralyzedwaiting for the moving of the water; for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and stirred the water: whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had. One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, He said to him, Do you want to be healed? The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me. Jesus said to him, Get up, take up your bed, and walk. And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.\n\nNow that day was the Sabbath. So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed. But he answered them, The man who healed me, that man said to me, Take up your bed, and walk. They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk? Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you. The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath. But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I am working.\n\nThis was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.The Authority of the Son\n\nSo Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of His own accord, but only what He sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all that He Himself is doing. And greater works than these will He show Him, so that you may marvel. For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He will. The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.\n\nTruly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son also to have life in Himself. And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man. Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear His voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.\n\nI can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of Him who sent me. If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true. There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that He bears about me is true. You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me. And the Father who sent me has Himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, His form you have never seen, and you do not have His word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom He has sent. You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. I do not receive glory from people. But I know that you do not have the love of God within you. I have come in my Father&apos;s name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope. For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"

And Jesus answered them, Have you not read what David did when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him? Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.

And they asked Him, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? But He knew their thoughts, and He said to the man with the withered hand, Come and stand here. And He rose and stood there. And Jesus said to them, Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it? But they were silent. And after looking around at them all with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And the man stretched it out, and his hand was restored, healthy like the other. But the Pharisees were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.

And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all the crowd sought to touch Him, for power came out from Him and healed them all. Seeing the crowds, He went up on the mountain, and when He sat down, His disciples came to Him. And He lifted up His eyes on His disciples, and He opened His mouth and taught them, saying:The Beatitudes\n\nBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n\nBlessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.\n\nBlessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\n\nBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.\n\nBlessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.\n\nBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\n\nBlessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.\n\nBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&apos; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n\nBlessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on account of the Son of Man! Rejoice in that day and be glad, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers persecuted the prophets who were before you.\n\nBut woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.\n\nWoe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry.\n\nWoe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.\n\nWoe to you, when all people speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets.Salt and Light\n\nYou are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people&apos;s feet.\n\nYou are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.Christ Came to Fulfill the Law\n\nDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.Anger\n\nYou have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, You fool! will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.Lust\n\nYou have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery. But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.Divorce\n\nIt was also said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.Oaths\n\nAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn. But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is His footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let what you say be simply Yes or No anything more than this comes from evil.Retaliation\n\nYou have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.Love Your Enemies\n\nYou have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, and pray for those who abuse and persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from one who takes away your cloak do not withhold your tunic either. Give to everyone who begs from you, and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back. And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them.\n\nIf you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you, what reward do you have? For even tax collectors and sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount. And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for He is kind to the ungrateful and the evil. You therefore must be perfect and merciful, as your heavenly Father is perfect and merciful.Giving to the Needy\n\nBeware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.\n\nThus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.The Lord&apos;s Prayer\n\nAnd when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.\n\nAnd when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. Pray then like this:\n\nOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever. Amen. For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.Fasting\n\nAnd when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.Lay Up Treasures in Heaven\n\nDo not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\n\nThe eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!\n\nNo one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.Do Not Be Anxious\n\nTherefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear? For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\n\nTherefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.Judging Others\n\nJudge not, and you will not be judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you.\n\nHe also told them a parable: Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother&apos;s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother&apos;s eye.\n\nDo not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you.Ask, and It Will Be Given\n\nAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!The Golden Rule\n\nSo whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.\n\nEnter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.A Tree and Its Fruit\n\nBeware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&apos;s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.I Never Knew You\n\nNot everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name? And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.Build Your House on the Rock\n\nBut why do you call Me Lord, Lord, and not do the things which I say? Everyone who comes to me and hears these words of mine and does them, I will show you what he is like: he is like a wise man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And the rain fell, and when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been well built: founded on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand without a foundation. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and when the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.The Authority of Jesus\n\nAnd when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at His teaching, for He was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.\n\nWhen He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him."

Now a centurion had a servant who was lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly and at the point of death, who was highly valued by him. When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to Him elders of the Jews, asking Him to come and heal his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with Him earnestly, saying, He is worthy to have you do this for him, for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue. And Jesus said to them, I will come and heal him. And He went with them. When He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But only say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed Him, said, Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith. I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And to the centurion Jesus said, Go; let it be done for you as you have believed. And the servant was healed at that very moment. And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.\n\n[7] Luke 7:1 reveals that these events took place directly after the previous events recorded in Luke 6:17-49."

As He drew near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable crowd from the town was with her. And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep. Then He came up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, arise. And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.

    "content": "Matthew 11:2-30; Luke 7:18-35\n\nNow when the disciples of John reported all these things to him in prison about the deeds of the Christ, John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent word by them to the Lord, saying, Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another? And when the men had come to Him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another? In that hour He healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and on many who were blind He bestowed sight. And Jesus answered them, Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\n\nWhen John&apos;s messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings&apos; courts. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you. Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. (When all the people heard this, and the tax collectors too, they declared God just, having been baptized with the baptism of John, but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)\n\nBut to what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like? They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn. For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, He has a demon. The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.\n\nThen He began to denounce the cities where most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.Come to Me, and I Will Give You Rest\n\nAt that time Jesus declared, I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him. Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."

And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that He was reclining at table in the Pharisee&apos;s house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, and standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed His feet and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner. And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he answered, Say it, Teacher.\n\nA certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more? Simon answered, The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt. And He said to him, You have judged rightly. Then turning toward the woman He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgivenfor she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little. And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven. Then those who were at table with Him began to say among themselves, Who is this, who even forgives sins? And He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace."

And when His family heard it, they went out to seize Him, for they were saying, He is out of His mind.\n\nThen a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to Him, and He healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. And all the people were amazed, and said, Can this be the Son of David? But when the Pharisees and the scribes who came down from Jerusalem heard it, they said, He is possessed by Beelzebul. It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons. Knowing their thoughts, He called them to Him and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand but is laid waste. And if a city or house is divided against itself, that city or house will not be able to stand. And if Satan casts out Satan, he has risen up against himself and is divided, how then will his kingdom stand? He cannot stand, but is coming to an end. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. But no one can enter a strong man&apos;s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house. Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.\n\nTherefore truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness. And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come, but is guilty of an eternal sinfor they were saying, He has an unclean spirit.\n\nEither make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit. You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.The Sign of Jonah\n\nThen some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you. But He answered them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.\n\nWhen the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. Then it says, I will return to my house from which I came. And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order. Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation."

And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, This man receives sinners and eats with them.The Parable of the Lost Sheep\n\nSo He told them this parable: What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost. Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.The Parable of the Lost Coin\n\nOr what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost. Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.The Parable of the Prodigal Son\n\nAnd He said, There was a man who had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me. And he divided his property between them. Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.\n\nBut when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father&apos;s hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.&quot; And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. But the father said to his servants, Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to celebrate.\n\nNow his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound. But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, but he answered his father, Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him! And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.The Parable of the Dishonest Manager\n\nHe also said to the disciples, There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions. And he called him and said to him, What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager. And the manager said to himself, What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses. So, summoning his master&apos;s debtors one by one, he said to the first, How much do you owe my master? He said, A hundred measures of oil. He said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty. Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? He said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty. The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.\n\nOne who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful in that which is another&apos;s, who will give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.The Law and the Kingdom of God\n\nThe Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed Him. And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.\n\nThe Law and the Prophets were until John; since then the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone forces his way into it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.\n\nEveryone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.The Rich Man and Lazarus\n\nThere was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man&apos;s table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham&apos;s side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. And he called out, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame. But Abraham said, Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us. And he said, Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father&apos;s house for I have five brothersso that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment. But Abraham said, They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them. And he said, No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent. He said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.Temptations to Sin\n\nAnd He said to His disciples, Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come! It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, I repent, you must forgive him.\n\nThe apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith! And the Lord said, If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, Be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey you.Unworthy Servants\n\nWill any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, Come at once and recline at table? Will he not rather say to him, Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink? Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty."

And when Jesus came to the other side and had stepped out of the boat onto land, immediately two demon-possessed men met Him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way. One of them was a man with an unclean spirit from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but lived among the tombs. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.) And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones. And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before Him. And crying out with a loud voice, he said, What have you to do with us, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Have you come here to torment us before the time? I beg you, I adjure you by God, do not torment us. For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man saying to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit! And Jesus asked him, What is your name? He replied, My name is Legion, for we are many, for many demons had entered him. And they begged Him earnestly not to send them out of the country and not to command them to depart into the abyss. Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside at some distance from them, and the demons begged Him to let them enter these, saying, If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs. So He gave them permission and said to them, Go. Then the demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.\n\nWhen the herdsmen saw what had happened they fled, and going into the city and in the country they told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men. Then all the city went out to see what it was that had happened. And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man from whom the demons had gone, the one who had had the legion, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. And those who had seen it described to them how the demon-possessed man had been healed and what had happened to the pigs. Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes begged Jesus to depart from their region, for they were seized with great fear. As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged Him that he might be with Him. And He did not permit him but said to him, Go, return to your home and to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord God has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you. And he went away and began to proclaim throughout the whole city and in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled. And getting into a boat Jesus crossed over again to the other side. Now when Jesus returned, a great crowd gathered about and welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him, and He was beside the sea, and He came to His own city."

How are such mighty works done by his hands? Is not this the carpenter&apos;s son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\n\nAnd they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household. And He could not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them. And He marveled because of their unbelief."

    "title": "Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Apostles",
    "content": "Matthew 9:3511:1; Mark 6:6b-13; Luke 9:1-6\n\nAnd Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. When He saw the crowds, He had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.\n\nAnd He called to Him His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons and the unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction. The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.\n\nThese twelve Jesus sent out two by two to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal, instructing them, Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And proclaim as you go, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay. He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staffno bread, no bag, acquire no gold or silver or copper in their beltsbut to wear sandals and do not have two tunics or sandals or a staff, for the laborer deserves his food. And He said to them, And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and whatever house you enter, stay there until you depart from there. As you enter the house, greet it. And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to your words, when you leave that house or town, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them. Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.Persecution Will Come\n\nBehold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death, and you will be hated by all for my name&apos;s sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\n\nA disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of His household.Have No Fear\n\nSo have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.Not Peace, but a Sword\n\nDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a person&apos;s enemies will be those of his own household. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.Rewards\n\nWhoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives Him who sent me. The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet&apos;s reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person&apos;s reward. And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.\n\nWhen Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their cities. And they departed and went out through the villages, preaching the gospel and proclaimed that people should repent. And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them everywhere."

King Herod heard about the fame of Jesus, for Jesus&apos; name had become known, and he said to his servants, John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things? This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him. And he sought to see Him. For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&apos;s wife, because he had married her. For John had been saying to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother&apos;s wife. And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly. But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you. And he vowed to her, Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom. And she went out and said to her mother, For what should I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. And she came in immediately with haste to the king and prompted by her mother, she said, I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter. And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John&apos;s head. He went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb, and they went and told Jesus."

And when Jesus heard this, He said to them, Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while. For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. And He took them and withdrew from there in a boat to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias, to a desolate place by a town called Bethsaida. Now many saw them going and recognized them, and when the crowds learned it, they ran there, following Him on foot from all the towns because they saw the signs that He was doing on the sick, and got there ahead of them. When He went ashore He saw a great crowd, and He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples. And He welcomed the crowds and began to teach them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing. Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. And when the day began to wear away and it grew late, His twelve disciples came to Him and said, This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and buy food for themselves. But Jesus said, They need not go away; you give them something to eat. And they said to Him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat? Lifting up His eyes, then, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward Him, Jesus said to Philip, Where are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat? He said this to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do. Philip answered Him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to get a little. For there were about five thousand men. And He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&apos;s brother, said to Him, There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they for so many? And He said, Bring them here to me. Now there was much green grass in the place. Jesus commanded His disciples, Have the people sit down in groups of about fifty each. So the crowds sat down in groups on the green grass, by hundreds and by fifties. Jesus then took the five loaves and the two fish, and He looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds who were seated. So also He divided the two fish among them all, as much as they wanted. And when they had eaten their fill and were satisfied, He told His disciples, Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost. So they gathered up what was left over and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves and of the fish left by those who had eaten. And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children."

Perceiving then that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowds. And after He had taken leave of them, and had dismissed the crowds, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by Himself to pray.\n\nWhen evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them, and He was there alone on the land. But the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing against them. And He saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night, when they had rowed about three or four miles, He came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them, but when the disciples saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat they thought it was a ghost, and cried out in fear, It is a ghost! for they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.\n\nAnd Peter answered Him, Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. He said, Come. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, Lord, save me. Jesus immediately reached out His hand and took hold of him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt? Then they were glad to take Him into the boat. And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going. And they were utterly astounded, for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened. And those in the boat worshiped Him, saying, Truly you are the Son of God."

    "content": "John 6:227:1\n\nOn the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away alone. Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.\n\nWhen they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did you come here? Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on Him God the Father has set His seal. Then they said to Him, What must we do, to be doing the works of God? Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent. So they said to Him, Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. Jesus then said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. They said to Him, Sir, give us this bread always.\n\nJesus said to them, I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of Him who sent me. And this is the will of Him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that He has given me, but raise it up on the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.\n\nSo the Jews grumbled about Him, because He said, I am the bread that came down from heaven. They said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, I have come down from heaven? Jesus answered them, Do not grumble among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to menot that anyone has seen the Father except He who is from God; He has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.\n\nThe Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers ate, and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever. Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as He taught at Capernaum.The Words of Eternal Life\n\nWhen many of His disciples heard it, they said, This is a hard saying; who can listen to it? But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, Do you take offense at this? Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before? It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray Him.) And He said, This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.\n\nAfter this many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him. So Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you want to go away as well? Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God. Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the Twelve? And yet one of you is a devil. He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray Him.\n\nAfter this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him."

    "title": "Traditions and Commandments",
    "content": "Matthew 15:1-20; Mark 7:1-23\n\nThen the Pharisees with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered to Jesus. They saw that some of His disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, holding to the tradition of the elders, and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.) And the Pharisees and the scribes asked Him, Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders and not walk according it? For they do not wash their hands when they eat, but eat with defiled hands. And He answered them, And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, as it is written, This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men. You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.\n\nAnd He said to them, You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition! For God commanded and Moses said, Honor your father and your mother, and, Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die. But you say, If a man tells his father or his mother, Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban&quot; (that is, given to God)he need not honor his father or mother, then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do.What Defiles a Person\n\nAnd He called the people to Him again and said to them, Hear me, all of you, and understand: There is nothing outside a person that by going into the mouth can defile him, but the things that come out of the mouth of a person are what defile him. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\nAnd when He had entered the house and left the people, the disciples came and said to Him, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying? He answered, Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.\n\nThen His disciples asked Him about the parable. Peter said to Him, Explain the parable to us. And He said to them, Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth of a person from outside cannot defile him, since it enters not his heart but passes into his stomach, and is expelled? (Thus He declared all foods clean.) And He said, But what comes out of the mouth of a person proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles him. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, adultery, sexual immorality, murder, theft, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, false witness, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and these are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone."

But immediately a Canaanite woman from that region whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of Him and came out and fell down at His feet. Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged Him to cast the demon out of her daughter, crying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon. But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and begged Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us. He answered, I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. But she came and knelt before Him, saying, Lord, help me. And He answered, Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children&apos;s bread and throw it to the dogs. But she answered Him, Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children&apos;s crumbs that fall from their masters&apos; table. Then Jesus answered her, O woman, great is your faith!

And the disciples answered Him, saying, Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd? And Jesus asked them, How many loaves do you have? They said, Seven, and a few small fish. And He directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, He broke them and gave them to His disciples to set before the people; and the disciples set them before the crowd.

And He sent him to his home, saying, Do not even enter the village."

And on the way He asked His disciples, Who do the crowds of people say that the Son of Man is? And they answered, Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets of old has risen. Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, it happened that as He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He asked them, But who do you say that I am? Simon Peter answered, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered him, saying, Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Then He strictly charged and commanded the disciples to tell no one about Him that He was the Christ."

And He said this plainly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you. But turning and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.\n\nAnd calling the crowd to Him with His disciples, He said to them all, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it and save it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul or forfeits himself? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in His glory and the glory of His Father with the holy angels, and then He will repay each person according to what he has done. And He said to them, Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in the kingdom of God with power."

    "content": "Matthew 17:1-13; Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-37a\n\nNow about eight days after these sayings Jesus took with Him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves to pray. And as He was praying, He was transfigured before them: the appearance of His face was altered and shone like the sun, and His clothing became radiant, intensely white as dazzling light, as no one on earth could bleach them. And behold, two men were talking with Jesus, Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory and spoke of His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him. And as the men were parting from Him, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, Master, Rabbi, it is good that we are here. If you wish, let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah. For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified. He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, my Chosen One, with whom I am well pleased; listen to Him! When the disciples heard the voice, they fell on their faces and were terrified. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, Rise, and have no fear. And suddenly, when they lifted up their eyes, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.\n\nOn the next day, as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen. So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean. And the disciples asked Him, Why then do the scribes say that first Elijah must come? And He answered them, Elijah does come first to restore all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man that He should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands. Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them of John the Baptist."

    "content": "Matthew 17:14-21; Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37b-43a[10]\n\nWhen they had come down from the mountain to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. And immediately all the crowd, when they saw Him, were greatly amazed and ran up to Him and greeted Him. And He asked them, What are you arguing about with them? And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. And whenever it seizes him he suddenly cries out. It convulses him so that it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him. The man came up to Him and, kneeling before Him, said, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly. And I brought him to your disciples, and I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not heal him. Jesus answered, O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring your son here to me. And they brought the boy to Him. And while he was coming, when the spirit saw Him, immediately the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. And Jesus asked his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood. And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us. And Jesus said to him, &apos;If you can&apos;! All things are possible for one who believes. Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears and said, I believe; help my unbelief! And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, saying to it, You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again. And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out of him, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, He is dead. But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and the boy was healed instantly, and he arose, and Jesus gave him back to his father. And all were astonished at the majesty of God. And when He had entered the house, then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, Why could we not cast it out? He said to them, Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you. But this kind never comes out except by prayer and fasting.\n\n[10] When the Bible was written there were neither chapter nor verse divisions.

As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus was teaching His disciples, saying to them, Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day.

    "title": "Jesus at the Feast of Booths",
    "content": "John 7:2-52\n\nNow the Jews Feast of Booths was at hand. So His brothers said to Him, Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing. For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world. For not even His brothers believed in Him. Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always here. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil. You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come. After saying this, He remained in Galilee.\n\nBut after His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He also went up, not publicly but in private. The Jews were looking for Him at the feast, and saying, Where is he? And there was much muttering about Him among the people. While some said, He is a good man, others said, No, he is leading the people astray. Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of Him.\n\nAbout the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied? So Jesus answered them, My teaching is not mine, but His who sent me. If anyone&apos;s will is to do God&apos;s will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true, and in Him there is no falsehood. Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me? The crowd answered, You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you? Jesus answered them, I did one work, and you all marvel at it. Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man&apos;s whole body well? Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.\n\nSome of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from. So Jesus proclaimed, as He taught in the temple, You know me, and you know where I come from. But I have not come of my own accord. He who sent me is true, and Him you do not know. I know Him, for I come from Him, and He sent me. So they were seeking to arrest Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. Yet many of the people believed in Him. They said, When the Christ appears, will He do more signs than this man has done?\n\nThe Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about Him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest Him. Jesus then said, I will be with you a little longer, and then I am going to Him who sent me. You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come. The Jews said to one another, Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? What does he mean by saying, You will seek me and you will not find me, and, Where I am you cannot come?Rivers of Living Water\n\nOn the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water. Now this He said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\n\nWhen they heard these words, some of the people said, This really is the Prophet. Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Is the Christ to come from Galilee? Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was? So there was a division among the people over Him. Some of them wanted to arrest Him, but no one laid hands on Him.\n\nThe officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why did you not bring him? The officers answered, No one ever spoke like this man! The Pharisees answered them, Have you also been deceived? Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him? But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed. Nicodemus, who had gone to Him before, and who was one of them, said to them, Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does? They replied, Are you from Galilee too? Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee."

All the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them. The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst they said to Him, Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say? This they said to test Him, that they might have some charge to bring against Him. Jesus bent down and wrote with His finger on the ground. And as they continued to ask Him, He stood up and said to them, Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her. And once more He bent down and wrote on the ground. But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before Him. Jesus stood up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you? She said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more."

    "content": "John 8:12-59\n\nAgain Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. So the Pharisees said to Him, You are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true. Jesus answered, Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one. Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me. In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true. I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me. They said to Him therefore, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also. These words He spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; but no one arrested Him, because His hour had not yet come.\n\nSo He said to them again, I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come. So the Jews said, Will he kill himself, since he says, Where I am going, you cannot come? He said to them, You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins. So they said to Him, Who are you? Jesus said to them, Just what I have been telling you from the beginning. I have much to say about you and much to judge, but He who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from Him. They did not understand that He had been speaking to them about the Father. So Jesus said to them, When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me. And He who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him. As He was saying these things, many believed in Him.The Truth Will Set You Free\n\nSo Jesus said to the Jews who had believed Him, If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. They answered Him, We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, You will become free?\n\nJesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. I know that you are offspring of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.You Are of Your Father the Devil\n\nThey answered Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham&apos;s children, you would be doing the works Abraham did, but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. You are doing the works your father did. They said to Him, We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Fathereven God. Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but He sent me. Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&apos;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.Before Abraham Was, I Am\n\nThe Jews answered Him, Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon? Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and He is the judge. Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death. The Jews said to Him, Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death. Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be? Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, He is our God. But you have not known Him. I know Him. If I were to say that I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know Him and I keep His word. Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad. So the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham? Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am. So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple."

    "title": "Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind",
    "content": "John 9:1-41\n\nAs He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth. And His disciples asked Him, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him. We must work the works of Him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. Having said these things, He spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then He anointed the man&apos;s eyes with the mud and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.\n\nThe neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, Is this not the man who used to sit and beg? Some said, It is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He kept saying, I am the man. So they said to him, Then how were your eyes opened? He answered, The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and received my sight. They said to him, Where is he? He said, I do not know.\n\nThey brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see. Some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them. So they said again to the blind man, What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.\n\nThe Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight and asked them, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see? His parents answered, We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself. (His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.) Therefore his parents said, He is of age; ask him.\n\nSo for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner. He answered, Whether He is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see. They said to him, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes? He answered them, I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples? And they reviled him, saying, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from. The man answered, Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where He comes from, and yet He opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, God listens to him. Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, He could do nothing. They answered him, You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us? And they cast him out.\n\nJesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him He said, Do you believe in the Son of Man? He answered, And who is He, sir, that I may believe in Him? Jesus said to him, You have seen Him, and it is He who is speaking to you. He said, Lord, I believe, and he worshiped Him. Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind. Some of the Pharisees near Him heard these things, and said to Him, Are we also blind? Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, We see, your guilt remains."

    "content": "John 10:1-21\n\nTruly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers. This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what He was saying to them.\n\nSo Jesus again said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.\n\nThere was again a division among the Jews because of these words. Many of them said, He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him? Others said, These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"

And when he said, From others, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free. However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel.

But they kept silent, for on the way an argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. And He sat down and called the twelve. The disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, said to them, If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all. And calling to Him a child, He put him by His side in the midst of them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them, Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but Him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.Anyone Not Against Us Is for Us\n\nJohn answered, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us. But Jesus said, Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. For the one who is not against us is for us. For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.Temptations to Sin\n\nWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea and drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes! And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the eternal unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life in the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire, where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched. For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt. Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.The Parable of the Lost Sheep\n\nSee that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. For the Son of Man came to save the lost. What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.If Your Brother Sins Against You\n\nIf your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant\n\nThen Peter came up and said to Him, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times? Jesus said to him, I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.\n\nTherefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything. And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, Pay what you owe. So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, Have patience with me, and I will pay you. He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt. When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place. Then his master summoned him and said to him, You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you? And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt. So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."

And He sent messengers ahead of Him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make preparations for Him. But the people did not receive Him, because His face was set toward Jerusalem. And when His disciples James and John saw it, they said, Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them? But He turned and rebuked them, and He said, You do not know what manner of spirit you are of; for the Son of Man came not to destroy people&apos;s lives but to save them.

Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus&apos; feet, giving Him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan.

And again, as was His custom, He taught them.\n\nAnd Pharisees came up and in order to test Him asked, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause? He answered them, What did Moses command you? They said, Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away. And Jesus said to them, Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery against her, and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.\n\nAnd in the house the disciples asked Him again about this matter, If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry. But He said to them, Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and greet no one on the road. Whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house! And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you.

But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls. And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are safe; but when one stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted and divides his spoil.

It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.

And He said to them, Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one&apos;s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. And He told them a parable, saying, The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops? And he said, I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.&quot; But God said to him, Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be? So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.Do Not Be Anxious\n\nAnd He said to His disciples, Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest? Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith! And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be worried. For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them. Instead, seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you.\n\nFear not, little flock, for it is your Father&apos;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.You Must Be Ready\n\nStay dressed for action and keep your lamps burning, and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and knocks. Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will dress himself for service and have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them. If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants! But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have left his house to be broken into. You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.\n\nPeter said, Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all? And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that servant says to himself, My master is delayed in coming, and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful. And that servant who knew his master&apos;s will but did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating. But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.Not Peace, but Division\n\nI came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled! I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how great is my distress until it is accomplished! Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three. They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.Interpreting the Time\n\nHe also said to the crowds, When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, A shower is coming. And so it happens. And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, There will be scorching heat, and it happens. You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?Settle with Your Accuser\n\nAnd why do you not judge for yourselves what is right? As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison. I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the very last penny."

Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your Law, I said, you are gods?

It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. So the sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, he whom you love is ill. But when Jesus heard it He said, This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\n\nNow Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. So, when He heard that Lazarus was ill, He stayed two days longer in the place where He was. Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go to Judea again. The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him. After saying these things, He said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him. The disciples said to Him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover. Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus has died, and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him. So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.\n\nNow when Jesus came, He found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met Him, but Mary remained seated in the house. Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you. Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again. Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day. Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this? She said to Him, Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.\n\nWhen she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, The Teacher is here and is calling for you. And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to Him. Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met Him. When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in His spirit and greatly troubled. And He said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept. So the Jews said, See how he loved him! But some of them said, Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?\n\nThen Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to Him, Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days. Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God? So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me. When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out. The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go."

She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, Woman, you are freed from your disability. And He laid His hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God. But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day. Then the Lord answered him, You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it? And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day? As He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame, and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by Him.The Mustard Seed and the Leaven\n\nHe said therefore, What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.\n\nAnd again He said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

And He said to them, Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out? And they could not reply to these things.The Parable of the Wedding Feast\n\nNow He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noticed how they chose the places of honor, saying to them, When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him, and he who invited you both will come and say to you, Give your place to this person, and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, Friend, move up higher. Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.The Parable of the Great Banquet\n\nHe said also to the man who had invited Him, When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.\n\nWhen one of those who reclined at table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God! But He said to him, A man once gave a great banquet and invited many. And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, Come, for everything is now ready. But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. Please have me excused. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame. And the servant said, Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room. And the master said to the servant, Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.

And they will say to you, Look, there! or Look, here! Do not go out or follow them. For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in His day. But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man. They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lotthey were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building, but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all so will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed. On that day, let the one who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back. Remember Lot&apos;s wife. Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will keep it. I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken and the other left. There will be two women grinding together. One will be taken and the other left. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. And they said to Him, Where, Lord?

And Jesus said to Him, Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. If you would enter life, keep the commandments. He said to Him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You know the commandments: Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The young man said to Him, Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack? When Jesus heard this, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, If you would be perfect, you lack one thing: go, sell all that you possess and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard these things, disheartened by the saying, he went away very sorrowful, for he was extremely rich and had great possessions.\n\nJesus, seeing that he had become sad, looked around and said to His disciples, Truly, I say to you, how difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of heaven! And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus said to them again, Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God! Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. And when the disciples heard this, they were exceedingly astonished, and said to Him, Then who can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God. Then Peter said in reply to Him, See, we have left our homes and everything and followed you. What then will we have?\n\nAnd Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses or wife or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name&apos;s sake and for the gospel of the kingdom of God, will receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come will inherit eternal life.

After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and to them he said, You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you. So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, Why do you stand here idle all day? They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You go into the vineyard too. And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first. And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, saying, These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat. But he replied to one of them, Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity? So the last will be first, and the first last."

And they said to Him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father. And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at the two brothers, James and John.

So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was about to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I must stay at your house today. So he hurried and came down and received Him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all grumbled, He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor.

He said therefore, A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return. Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, Engage in business until I come. But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us. When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business. The first came before him, saying, Lord, your mina has made ten minas more. And he said to him, Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities. And the second came, saying, Lord, your mina has made five minas. And he said to him, And you are to be over five cities. Then another came, saying, Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief; for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow. He said to him, I will condemn you with your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest? And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas. And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas! I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me.\n\nAnd when He had said these things, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem."

They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all? Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest Him.\n\nSix days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. And while He was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, they gave a dinner for Him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him at table. As He was reclining at table, Mary came with an alabaster flask of a pound of ointment made from pure nard, very expensive, and she broke the flask and poured it over His head, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But when the disciples saw it, there were some who said to themselves indignantly, Why was the ointment wasted like that? Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples (he who was about to betray Him), said, Why was this ointment not sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor? He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it. And they scolded her. But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me. She has done what she could; in pouring this ointment on my body, she has anointed my body beforehand to prepare me for the day of my burial. And truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.\n\nWhen the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of Him but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.\n\n[12] Matthew and Mark begin to tell a new story to tie in the betrayal of Judas Iscariot.

Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says to you, Why are you doing this?, you shall say, The Lord has need of them and will send them back here immediately, and he will send them at once. This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying, Say to the daughter of Zion, Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden. The disciples who were sent went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street just as He had told them. And as they were untying the colt as Jesus had directed them, its owners standing there said to them, What are you doing, why are you untying the colt? And they said, The Lord has need of it.

And when He had looked around at everything, as it was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.\n\nHis disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about Him and had been done to Him. The crowd that had been with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness. The reason why the crowd went to meet Him was that they heard He had done this sign. So the Pharisees said to one another, You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after him."

And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf by the wayside, He went to see if He could find anything on it. When He came to it, He found nothing on it but only leaves, for it was not the season for figs. And He said to it, May no fruit ever come from you again! May no one ever eat fruit from you again. And His disciples heard it. And the fig tree withered at once."

When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree wither at once? And Peter remembered and said to Him, Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered. And Jesus answered them, Have faith in God. Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and thrown into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours, if you have faith. And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses."

    "title": "The Authority of Jesus Challenged",
    "content": "Matthew 21:2322:14; Mark 11:2712:12; Luke 20:1-19\n\nAnd they came again to Jerusalem. And when Jesus entered the temple, and as He was walking and teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people came up to Him as He was teaching, and they said to Him, Tell us by what authority are you doing these things, or who it is that gave you this authority to do them? Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. Now tell me, the baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man? Answer me. And they discussed it with one another among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why then did you not believe him? But if we shall say, From man, we are afraid all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John really was a prophet. So they answered Jesus, We do not know where it came from. And Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.The Parable of the Two Sons\n\nAnd He began to speak to the people in parables. What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, Son, go and work in the vineyard today. And he answered, I will not, but afterward he changed his mind and went. And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, I go, sir, but did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father? They said, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.The Parable of the Tenants\n\nHear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress in it and built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went into another country for a long while. When the season for fruit drew near, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of his fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. Again he sent to them another servant. But they also beat and struck him on the head and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed. And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out. And he sent another, and him they killed. And he sent many other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them: some they beat, and some they killed. Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent his son to them, saying, I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him. But when those tenants saw the son, they said to one another, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance will be ours. And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what then will he do to those tenants? He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons. When they heard this, they said to Him, Surely not!\n\nBut Jesus looked directly at them and said to them, What then is this that is written? Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord&apos;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes? Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.\n\nWhen the scribes and the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they sought to lay hands on Him at that very hour, for they perceived that He was speaking about them and had told the parable against them. And although they were seeking to arrest Him, they feared the people, because they held Him to be a prophet. So they left Him and went away.The Parable of the Wedding Feast\n\nAnd again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. Again he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.&quot; But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. Then he said to his servants, The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find. And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.\n\n&quot;But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. And he said to him, Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless. Then the king said to the attendants, Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen."

So they watched Him and sent to Him spies, some of the Pharisees disciples and some of the Herodians, who pretended to be sincere, that they might trap Him in something He said, so as to deliver Him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. And they came and asked Him, Teacher, we know that you are true and that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not care about anyone&apos;s opinion, and show no partiality. For you are not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful for us to give tribute and pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not? But Jesus, aware of their malice, perceived their craftiness and hypocrisy, and said to them, Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax. Bring me a denarius and let me look at it. And they brought Him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, Whose likeness and inscription does it have? They said to Him, Caesar&apos;s. Then Jesus said to them, Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&apos;s, and to God the things that are God&apos;s. And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch Him in what He said, but marveling at His answer they became silent. And they left Him and went away."

Now there were seven brothers among us. The first took a wife and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother. And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise took her, and likewise all seven left no offspring and died. Last of all the woman also died. In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven all had her as wife.\n\nBut Jesus answered them, You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels in heaven and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. And as for the dead being raised, have you not read what was said to you by God in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to Him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? Now He is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to Him. You are quite wrong. And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at His teaching. Then some of the scribes answered, Teacher, you have spoken well."

And one of the scribes, a lawyer, came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that He answered them well, asked Him a question to test Him, Teacher, which great commandment in the Law is the most important of all? Jesus answered and said to him, The most important is, Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets. And the scribe said to Him, You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that He is one, and there is no other besides Him. And to love Him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one&apos;s neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that they no longer dared to ask Him any more questions."

For David himself, in the Holy Spirit, calls Him Lord, saying in the Book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool under your feet?

For they preach, but do not practice. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people&apos;s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by others. Beware of the scribes, for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, who like to walk around in long robes, and they love the place of honor at feasts and have the best seats in the synagogues and like greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\n\nBut woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people&apos;s faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows&apos; houses and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.\n\nWoe to you, blind guides, who say, If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath. You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? And you say, If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath. You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it. And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.\n\nWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!\n\nWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean.\n\nWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people&apos;s bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.\n\nWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, saying, If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets. Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.\n\nO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! See, your house is left to you desolate.

And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings, one of His disciples said to Him, Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings! But He answered and said to them, Do you see all these great buildings? Truly, I say to you, the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.Signs of the End of the Age\n\nAnd as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, the disciples Peter and James and John and Andrew came to Him privately, and they asked Him, saying, Teacher, tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming when these things are about to take place and be accomplished, and of the end of the age? And Jesus answered and began to say to them, See that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, I am he, the Christ! and, The time is at hand! and they will lead many astray. Do not go after them. And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars and tumults, see that you are not alarmed. Do not be terrified, for these things must first take place, but the end will not yet be at once.\n\nThen He said to them, For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes in various places, and in various places there will be famines and pestilences in various places. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.\n\nBut be on your guard. Before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you over to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought to stand before kings and governors for my name&apos;s sake. This will be your opportunity to bear witness before them. And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another, even parents and brothers and relatives and friends. And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death. And you will be hated by all nations for my name&apos;s sake. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. Not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance you will gain your lives. And this gospel of the kingdom must first be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.The Abomination of Desolation\n\nBut when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing where he ought not to be in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it, for these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. Let the one who is on the housetop not go down into his house to take anything out, and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For in those days there will be such great tribulation and distress upon the earth, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation of the world that God created until now, no, and never will be. And if the Lord had not cut short those days, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, those days will be cut short. And there will be wrath against this people. They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive among all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. And then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ! or Look, there he is! do not believe it. But be on guard; see, I have told you all things beforehand. So, if they say to you, Look, he is in the wilderness, do not go out. If they say, Look, he is in the inner rooms, do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.The Coming of the Son of Man\n\nImmediately after the tribulation of those days there will be signs in sun and moon and stars: the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with great power and great glory. And then He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven. Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.The Lesson of the Fig Tree\n\nAnd He told them a parable: Look at the fig tree, and all the trees. From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you see for yourselves and know that the summer is already near. So also, when you see all these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near, at the very gates. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.No One Knows That Day or Hour\n\nBut concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap. For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth. Therefore, stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. Be on guard, keep awake and pray. For you do not know when the time will come. It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake. Therefore stay awakefor you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morninglest he come suddenly and find you asleep. And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake.\n\nWho then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says to himself, My master is delayed, and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.The Parable of the Ten Virgins\n\nThen the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him. Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered, saying, Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves. And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us. But he answered, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you. Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.The Parable of the Talents\n\nFor it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master&apos;s money. Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more. His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. But his master answered him, You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.The Final Judgment\n\nWhen the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. Before Him will be gathered all the nations, and He will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And He will place the sheep on His right, but the goats on the left. Then the King will say to those on His right, Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me. Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you? And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.\n\nThen He will say to those on His left, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me. Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you? Then He will answer them, saying, Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me. And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\n\nWhen Jesus had finished all these sayings, He said to His disciples, You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.\n\nAnd every day He was teaching in the temple, but at night He went out and lodged on the mount called Olivet. And early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple to hear Him."

He went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him to them, saying, What will you give me if I deliver him over to you? And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. So he consented and they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray Him to them in the absence of a crowd."

    "content": "John 12:20-50\n\nNow among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, Sir, we wish to see Jesus. Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. And Jesus answered them, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.\n\nNow is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name. Then a voice came from heaven: I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again. The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to him. Jesus answered, This voice has come for your sake, not mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself. He said this to show by what kind of death He was going to die. So the crowd answered Him, We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man? So Jesus said to them, The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.The Unbelief of the People\n\nWhen Jesus had said these things, He departed and hid Himself from them. Though He had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in Him, so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said, He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them. Isaiah said these things because he saw His glory and spoke of Him. Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in Him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue; for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God.\n\nAnd Jesus cried out and said, Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in Him who sent me. And whoever sees me sees Him who sent me. I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has Himself given me a commandmentwhat to say and what to speak. And I know that His commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me."

    "content": "Matthew 26:17-29; Mark 14:12-25; Luke 22:7-30; John 13:1-32\n\nNow before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end. Then came the first day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it. They said to Him, Where will you have us prepare it? He said to them, Go into the city, and behold, when you have entered the city, a certain man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters and tell the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples. Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples? And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us. And the disciples set out and went to the city as Jesus had directed them, and found it just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.\n\nWhen it was evening, He came with the twelve, and when the hour came, He reclined at table with the twelve apostles with Him. And He said to them, I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.Who Is the Greatest?\n\nA dispute also arose among them, as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest. And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves. For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves.\n\nYou are those who have stayed with me in my trials, and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.Jesus Washes the Disciples&apos; Feet\n\nDuring supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&apos;s son, to betray Him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper. He laid aside His outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around His waist. Then He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&apos; feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around Him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to Him, Lord, do you wash my feet? Jesus answered him, What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand. Peter said to Him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no share with me. Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head! Jesus said to him, The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you. For He knew who was to betray Him; that was why He said, Not all of you are clean.\n\nWhen He had washed their feet and put on His outer garments and resumed His place, He said to them, Do you understand what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&apos;s feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me. I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am He. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.One of You Will Betray Me\n\nAfter saying these things, Jesus was troubled in His spirit, and as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus testified, Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, the hand of him who betrays me is eating with me on the table. The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom He spoke. And they began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this. And they were very sorrowful and began to say to Him one after another, Is it I, Lord? He said to them, It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined and is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born. One of His disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table at Jesus&apos; side, so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom He was speaking. So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to Him, Lord, who is it? Jesus answered, It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it. So when He had dipped the morsel, He gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, What you are going to do, do quickly. Judas, who would betray Him, answered, Is it I, Rabbi? He said to him, You have said so. Now no one at the table knew why He said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, Buy what we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.Institution of the Lord&apos;s Supper\n\nWhen he had gone out, Jesus said to them, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and glorify Him at once. Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when He had given thanks and after blessing it, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\n\nAnd likewise He took a cup after they had eaten, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, saying, Take this, and divide it among yourselves. Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Truly, I say to you, that from now on I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when the kingdom of God comes and I drink it new with you in my Father&apos;s kingdom. And they all drank of it."

You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, Where I am going you cannot come. A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\n\nSimon Peter said to Him, Lord, where are you going? Jesus answered him, Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward. Peter said to Him, Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you. Jesus answered, Will you lay down your life for me? Then Jesus said to them, You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee. Peter answered Him, Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away. But the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers. Peter said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death. And Jesus said to Him, Truly, truly, I tell you, Peter, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny that you know me three times. But Peter said emphatically to Him, Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you! And all the disciples said the same.\n\nAnd He said to them, When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything? They said, Nothing. He said to them, But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one. For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: And He was numbered with the transgressors. For what is written about me has its fulfillment.

If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way to where I am going. Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way? Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.\n\nPhilip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us. Jesus said to him, Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does His works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.\n\nTruly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit\n\nIf you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. You know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you.\n\nI will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him. Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world? Jesus answered him, If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father&apos;s who sent me.\n\nThese things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. You heard me say to you, I am going away, and I will come to you. If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place you may believe. I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no claim on me, but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go from here.I Am the True Vine\n\nI am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit He takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father&apos;s commandments and abide in His love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.\n\nThis is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, He may give it to you. These things I command you, so that you will love one another.The Hatred of the World\n\nIf the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know Him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: They hated me without a cause.\n\nBut when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness about me. And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.\n\nI have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away. They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me. But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you.The Work of the Holy Spirit\n\nI did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. But now I am going to Him who sent me, and none of you asks me, Where are you going? But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send Him to you. And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.\n\nI still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all the truth, for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak, and He will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for He will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that He will take what is mine and declare it to you.Your Sorrow Will Turn into Joy\n\nA little while, and you will see me no longer; and again a little while, and you will see me. So some of His disciples said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me and, because I am going to the Father? So they were saying, What does He mean by a little while? We do not know what He is talking about. Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him, so He said to them, Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me? Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, He will give it to you. Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.I Have Overcome the World\n\nI have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father. In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf; for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father.\n\nHis disciples said, Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech! Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; this is why we believe that you came from God. Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.The High Priestly Prayer\n\nWhen Jesus had spoken these words, He lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, since you have given Him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given Him. And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.\n\nI have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you. For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one. While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.\n\nI do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me. Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me. I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.&quot;"

And He said to His disciples, Sit here, while I go over there and pray. And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, James and John, He began to be greatly distressed and sorrowful and troubled. Then He said to them, My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me. Pray that you may not enter into temptation. And He withdrew from them, going a little farther, about a stone&apos;s throw, and knelt down on the ground and fell on His face and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him. And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. If you are willing, remove this cup and let it pass from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done. And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, Simon, are you asleep? So, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. Again, for the second time, He went away and prayed, saying the same words, My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done. And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer Him. So, leaving them again, He went away and there appeared to Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him. And being in an agony He prayed for the third time more earnestly, saying the same words again; and His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. And when He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples the third time and found them sleeping for sorrow, and He said to them, Sleep and take your rest later on. It is enough. See, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand. Now Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with His disciples."

Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard. And when he came, he went up to Jesus at once and said, Greetings, Rabbi! He drew near to Jesus to kiss Him, but Jesus said to him, Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss? Friend, do what you came to do. And he kissed Him. Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to Him, came forward and said to them, Whom do you seek? They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am He. Judas, who betrayed Him, was standing with them. When Jesus said to them, I am He, they drew back and fell to the ground. So He asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I told you that I am He. So, if you seek me, let these men go. This was to fulfill the word that He had spoken: Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one. Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him. And when those who were around Him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword? And then behold, one of those who stood by with Jesus, Simon Peter, having a sword, stretched out his hand and drew it and struck the high priest&apos;s servant and cut off his right ear. (The servant&apos;s name was Malchus.) But Jesus said, No more of this! And He touched his ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword back into its sheath. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me? Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and He will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so? Then at that hour Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against Him, Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me to seize me. But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. This is your hour, and the power of darkness.\n\nSo the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him and led Him away. Then all the disciples left Him and fled.\n\nAnd a young man followed Him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked."

    "content": "Matthew 26:5727:1; Mark 14:5315:1a; Luke 22:54b-71; John 18:13-27\n\nThen those who had seized Jesus first led Him into Annas the high priest&apos;s house, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.Peter Denies Jesus\n\nSimon Peter followed Jesus at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in. The servant girl at the door said to Peter, You also are not one of this man&apos;s disciples, are you? He said, I am not. And going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. Now the servants and officers had kindled a charcoal fire in the middle of the courtyard, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was among them, standing and warming himself. And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came, and seeing Peter as he sat in the light warming himself, and looking closely at him, said, You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus the Galilean. But he denied it before them all, saying, Woman, I do not know Him. I neither know nor understand what you mean. And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed. And when he went out to the entrance, a little later another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, This man was with Jesus of Nazareth. So they said to him, You also are not one of his disciples, are you? But again Peter denied it with an oath and said, Man, I am not. I do not know the man.Jesus Faces Annas\n\nThe high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching. Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret. Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said. When He had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Is that how you answer the high priest? Jesus answered him, If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me? Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.Peter Denies Jesus Again\n\nAnd after an interval of about an hour the bystanders came up and still another insisted, saying, Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your accent betrays you. One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, Did I not see you in the garden with him? Then Peter again denied it, and began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, Man, I do not know what you are talking about. I do not know this man of whom you speak. And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed a second time. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.[13] And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before the rooster crows twice today, you will deny me three times. And he went out and he broke down and wept bitterly.Jesus Before the Council\n\nAnd they led Jesus to Caiaphas the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put Him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and bore false witness against Him, saying, We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands. Yet even about this their testimony did not agree. And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you? But Jesus remained silent and made no answer. And the high priest said to Him, I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of the Blessed God. And Jesus said to him, I am, you have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest tore his garments and said, He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your decision? They answered, He deserves death. And they all condemned Him as deserving death.Jesus Is Mocked\n\nAnd some began to spit in His face and to cover His face and to strike Him, saying to Him, Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you? And the guards who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him as they beat Him with blows. They also blindfolded Him and kept asking Him, Prophesy! Who is it that struck you? And they said many other things against Him, blaspheming Him.Jesus Before the Council Again\n\nAnd as soon as it was morning, all the chief priests and the assembly of the elders of the people and scribes and the whole council gathered together and took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death. And they led Him away to their council, and they said, If you are the Christ, tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe, and if I ask you, you will not answer. But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God. So they all said, Are you the Son of God, then? And He said to them, You say that I am. Then they said, What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.\n\n[13] These three denials by Peter coincide with the questioning of Jesus before Annas. Thus when Annas sends Jesus to Caiaphas, Jesus passes Peter at the entrance to witness Peters third denial!"

Then the whole company of them arose and led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor&apos;s headquarters and delivered Him over to Pilate the governor. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor&apos;s headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover. So Pilate went outside to them and said, What accusation do you bring against this man? They answered him, If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you. Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death. This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death He was going to die. And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.\n\nSo Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus. Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus answered, Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me? Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world. Then Pilate said to Him, So you are a king? Jesus answered, You have said so, that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the worldto bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice. Pilate said to Him, What is truth?\n\nAfter he had said this, then Pilate went back outside to the Jews and told the chief priests and the crowds, I find no guilt in this man. But when the chief priests and elders accused Him of many things, He gave no answer. Then Pilate again asked Him, saying, Have you no answer to make? Do you not hear how many charges they testify against you? But Jesus gave him no further answer, not even to a single charge, so that Pilate the governor was greatly amazed. But they were urgent, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place. When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. And when he learned that He belonged to Herod&apos;s jurisdiction, he sent Him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time."

So he questioned Him at some length, but He made no answer. The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him. And Herod with his soldiers treated Him with contempt and mocked Him. Then, arraying Him in splendid clothing, he sent Him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other."

    "content": "Matthew 27:15-31; Mark 15:6-20; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:3919:16\n\nPilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, and said to them, You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him. Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him. I will therefore punish and release him.\n\nNow at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection started in the city, there was a notorious prisoner: a man called Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, You have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ, the King of the Jews? For he knew that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered Him up. Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream. Now the chief priests and the elders stirred up and persuaded the crowd to ask to have him release for them Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor again said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release for you? But they all cried out together, Not this man! Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas! Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus, saying, Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ, the King of the Jews? And they all cried out again, Let him be crucified! And they kept shouting, Crucify, crucify him! A third time Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him.\n\nThen Pilate took Jesus and flogged Him. Then the soldiers of the governor led Jesus away inside the palace into the governor&apos;s headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before Him. And they stripped Him and put a scarlet purple robe on Him. And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a reed in His right hand. And kneeling down in homage before Him, they mocked Him in salute, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they spit on Him and struck Him with their hands and took the reed and struck Him on the head. Pilate went out again and said to them, See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him. So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, Behold the man! When the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they cried out, Crucify him, crucify him! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him. The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God. When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid. He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer. So Pilate said to Him, You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you? Jesus answered him, You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.\n\nFrom then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, If you release this man, you are not Caesar&apos;s friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar. So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, Behold your King! But they were urgent, demanding all the more with loud cries, Away with him, away with him! Let him be crucified! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.\n\nSo when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this man&apos;s blood; see to it yourselves. And all the people answered, His blood be on us and on our children! And their voices prevailed. So then Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, decided that their demand should be granted. He released for them Barabbas, the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and they stripped Him of the purple robe and put His own clothes on Him. And they led Him out to crucify Him."

They said, What is that to us? See to it yourself. And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money. So they took counsel and bought with them the potter&apos;s field as a burial place for strangers. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter&apos;s field, as the Lord directed me.\n\n[14] Exactly when it was that Judas regretted his betrayal is not indicated, but the text leaves the impression that it was immediately after he knew that Jesus had been sentenced to death."

And as they led Him away, they found a passerby, a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus. And they seized this man and laid on him the cross, and compelled him to carry it behind Jesus. And there followed Him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for Him. But turning to them Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed! Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us. For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?\n\nTwo others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with Him. And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha, they offered Him wine to drink, mixed with myrrh, but when He tasted it, He would not drink it. There they crucified Him. Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews. Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but rather, This man said, I am King of the Jews. Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.\n\nWhen the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took His garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also His tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, so they said to one another, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be. This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. So the soldiers did these things. Then they sat down and kept watch over Him there. And it was the third hour when they crucified Him. And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. Then two robbers were crucified with Him, criminals, one on His right side and one on His left side, and Jesus between them. And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, He was numbered with the transgressors. And the people stood by, watching. And those who passed by derided Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross. So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked Him to one another, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, His Chosen One! He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if He desires him. For he said, I am the Son of God. The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up and offering Him sour wine and saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself! And the robbers who were crucified with Him also reviled Him in the same way.\n\nOne of the criminals who were hanged railed at Him, saying, Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us! But the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong. And he said, Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. And He said to him, Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\n\nStanding by the cross of Jesus were His mother and His mother&apos;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son! Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home."

And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? which means, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, Behold, this man is calling Elijah. After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), I thirst. A jar full of sour wine stood there, so one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with the sour wine, and put it on a hyssop branch and held it to His mouth to drink. But the others said, Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down and save him. When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, It is finished. Then Jesus, crying out again with a loud voice, said, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit! And having said this He bowed His head, breathed His last, and yielded up His spirit.\n\nAnd behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. Now when the centurion, who stood facing Him, saw that in this way He breathed His last, he praised God, saying, Certainly this man was innocent! Truly this man was the Son of God! And when those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe. And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts.\n\nAnd all His acquaintances stood at a distance watching these things. There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witnesshis testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truththat you also may believe.

He was a respected member of the council, a good and righteous man, who had not consented to their decision and action; and he was also himself looking for the kingdom of God. He took courage and went to Pilate and asked that he might take away the body of Jesus. Pilate was surprised to hear that He should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether He was already dead. And when he learned from the centurion that He was dead, then Pilate gave him permission and ordered the corpse to be given to Joseph. So Joseph bought a linen shroud, and he came and took His body down. Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in the clean linen shroud with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock, where no one had ever yet been laid. So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there. And he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, the mother of Joses, who had come with Him from Galilee were there, sitting opposite the tomb, and saw how His body was laid. Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment."

Now on the first day of the week, toward the dawn while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. When the sun had risen, the women came to the tomb. And they were saying to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb? And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back away from the tombit was very large. But when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.\n\nSo Mary Magdalene ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him. So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there by themselves, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there, and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus&apos; head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise from the dead. Then the disciples went back to their homes marveling at what had happened.\n\nWhile the women were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how He told you, while He was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise. And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. And the angel said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified. He is not here, for He has risen, as He said. Come, see the place where they laid Him. Then go quickly and tell His disciples and Peter that He has risen from the dead, and behold, He is going before you to Galilee. There you will see Him, just as He told you. And they remembered His words. So they departed quickly and fled from the tomb with fear and great joy, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid, and ran to tell His disciples. And behold, Jesus met them and said, Greetings! And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him. Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me. And returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.The Report of the Guard\n\nWhile they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers and said, Tell people, His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep. And if this comes to the governor&apos;s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble. So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene\n\nBut Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. They said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him. Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? Supposing Him to be the gardener, she said to Him, Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned and said to Him in Aramaic, Rabboni! (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God. Now He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons. Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept, I have seen the Lordand that He had said these things to her. But when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.\n\nNow it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.\n\n[15] This is a complex account with many parts of it happening simultaneously, but in written form it must be presented linearly. So keep in mind that when Mary Magdalene runs to tell Peter and John that the tomb is empty, she leaves the other women behind at the tomb. Those women have their encounter with the angels and leave. The guards also leave. Peter and John arrive at the tomb and then leave. And finally Mary Magdalene arrives once again at the tomb and, now alone, has her encounter with the angels and with Jesus Himself."

    "content": "Mark 16:12-13; Luke 24:13-35\n\nAfter these things, that very day, two of them, as they were walking into the country, were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. And they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him as He appeared in another form. And He said to them, What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk? And they stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered Him, Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days? And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to be condemned to death, and crucified Him. But we had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, and when they did not find His body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that He was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but Him they did not see. And He said to them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into His glory? And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.\n\nSo they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if He were going farther, but they urged Him strongly, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent. So He went in to stay with them. When He was at table with them, He took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him. And He vanished from their sight. They said to each other, Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked to us on the road, while He opened to us the Scriptures? And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying, The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon! Then they told what had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of the bread, but they did not believe them."

But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. And He said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have. And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet and His side. And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, He said to them, Have you anything here to eat? They gave Him a piece of broiled fish and some honeycomb, and He took it and ate before them. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. And He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw Him after He had risen.\n\nThen He said to them, These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled. Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. Jesus said to them again, Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you. And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.\n\nNow Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into His side, I will never believe.\n\nEight days later, His disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, Peace be with you. Then He said to Thomas, Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe. Thomas answered Him, My Lord and my God! Jesus said to him, Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."

    "content": "John 21:1-24\n\nAfter this Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and He revealed Himself in this way. Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We will go with you. They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.\n\nJust as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, Children, do you have any fish? They answered Him, No. He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, It is the Lord! When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea. The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.\n\nWhen they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish that you have just caught. So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast. Now none of the disciples dared ask Him, Who are you? They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after He was raised from the dead.\n\nWhen they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs. He said to him a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Tend my sheep. He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, Do you love me? and he said to Him, Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go. (This He said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this He said to him, Follow me.&quot;\n\nPeter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against Him during the supper and had said, Lord, who is it that is going to betray you? When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man? Jesus said to him, If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me! So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?\n\nThis is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true."

And when they saw Him they worshiped Him, but some doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

    "title": "The Ascension",
    "content": "Mark 16:19-20; Luke 24:46-53; Acts 1:3-11\n\nJesus presented Himself alive to them after His suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God, saying to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.\n\nAnd while staying with them He ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, He said, you heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.\n\nThen He led them out as far as Bethany. So when they had come together, they asked Him, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? He said to them, It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by His own authority. Behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high. You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. So then the Lord Jesus, after He had spoken these things to them, lifting up His hands He blessed them. While He blessed them, as they were looking on, He was lifted up, and a cloud took Him out of their sight. He parted from them and was carried up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. And while they were gazing into heaven as He went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, and said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw Him go into heaven. And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple blessing God. And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs."

But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name."
