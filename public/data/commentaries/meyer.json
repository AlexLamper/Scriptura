Esau is the only character which elicits universal sympathy. Isaac appears to have sunk into premature senility. It seems hardly credible that he who had borne the wood for the offering up Mount Moriah, and had yielded himself so absolutely to the divine will, would have become so keen an epicure. He could only be reached now through the senses. Perhaps this was due to the prosperity and even tenor of his life. It is better, after all, to live the strenuous life, with its uphill climb, than to be lapped in the ease of the valley. The birthright had been already promised to Jacob, and there was no need for him to win it by fraud; and Rebekah was truly blameworthy in that she deceived her husband, showed partiality toward her children, and acted unworthily of herself. Who would have expected that out of such a family God was about to produce the religious leaders of the world! Pharaoh would one day crave a blessing from those kid-lined hands!</p>",

Notice how one lie led to another! Few who enter on a course of deception stop at one falsehood; and how terrible it was to add blasphemy to lying, as when he said that God brought him his quarry in the hunt. Luther wonders how Jacob was able to brazen it out, adding, &#147;I should probably have run away in terror and let the dish fall.&#148; Rebekah kept her son&#146;s garments well perfumed with the aromatic plants of Palestine, and their odor awoke the sleeping poetry and fire of the aged father. He compared them to a field of Paradise, filled with the sweet presence of God. Let us see to it that we carry everywhere the fragrance of Christ.

His exceeding great and bitter cry expressed the anguish of one who awakes to discover that he has forfeited the best for a trifle. But obviously, he was only being held to his own original contract with Jacob. There are similar events in all lives when we take some irrevocable step under the sway of evil passion, and it affects the whole future. There is &#147;no place for repentance&#148;-<i>i.e</i>., no opportunity of altering the decisive effect, of that act. See <ref><reflink target=\"Heb 12:17\">Heb 12:17</reflink></ref>. We may obtain some lower and inferior blessing, as Esau did, acquiring something of the fatness of the earth and the dew of heaven, living by our sword, and finally, after long years, shaking the yoke from our neck, but we can never be what we might have been! We can never undo that moment of sowing to the flesh. See <ref><reflink target=\"Gal 6:7\">Gal 6:7</reflink>-8</ref>.</p>",

But Isaac lived for forty years after this. His secret purpose, however, became known to Rebekah. See <ref><reflink target=\"Pro 29:11\">Pro 29:11</reflink></ref>. The ostensible reason for Jacob&#146;s expatriation which Rebekah gave her husband was not the real one. He was sent to Haran, not primarily for a wife, but to escape his brother. Does not this constant duplicity explain the reason of Rebekah&#146;s heart-weariness? It seems probable that she never saw her favorite son again. The benediction already pronounced on Jacob was repeated with greater amplitude and tenderness as he left his father&#146;s tent. Sad as he was in the inevitable wrench, the star of hope shone in the sky, beckoning him onward. It was necessary that he should be taken from under his mother&#146;s influence into that greater world, where, through pain and disappointment, he should become a prince with God. Often our nest is broken up that we may learn to fly.</p>"

We think that we are to be dowered with Rachel, and lo! Leah is substituted; but in after-days Jacob spoke of Reuben as his might, the beginning of his dignity and excellency.

Indeed, in a later book, we are told, &#147;He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in Israel.&#148; Not that the holy God was unaware of the evil traits in His child, but that He refused to dwell on them, or to allow himself to be turned away from His purposes of grace.

He knew that thence must come all their hope and expectation; and God was &#147;in the shadow, keeping watch above His own.&#148; He was contriving and superintending the chain of events which were to set His young servant on the throne. Man had despised and rejected him, but God had already prepared for him a position of honor and usefulness, to which his ministry to these men was as rungs in the upward ladder. Do not neglect small acts of ministry. Faithfulness in the very little leads to the throne-life. The butler&#146;s forgetfulness reminds us of our shameful forgetfulness of the Redeemer, who has brought us up out of the pit, and redeemed us with precious blood. Yet He said: &#147;This do in remembrance of me.&#148;</p>"

Any sum which another has lost through us should, of course, be repaid, and a fifth part added, if required.

Indeed, we may almost detect in her noble and beautiful words some anticipation of the Psalms, which have gone singing down the ages.

It was because of her that Ruth was led to her supreme self-giving. She had never seen a suffering soul bear itself so heroically. She felt that, in the Hebrew faith, there was something which Chemosh had never imparted, to <i>her</i> people; she craved for herself some of the holy radiance that lingered on the worn face of Naomi.

When the whole story was detailed to the young shepherd, he looked at the incident and challenge from the spiritual side. This event, therefore, marked a turning-point not only in his own history, but in that of his people.

Circumstances may prevent the execution of a desire and a purpose with which, years ago, our hearts were filled. God, however, will never forget it, and will see that the project is carried out in some other way-perhaps by another instrument.

Is it not clear that Ahab, in his heart of hearts, feared this man of God?

But Micaiah did not scruple to say that the spirit of a demon was making use of their lips for the utterance of beguiling falsehood. He was evidently speaking metaphorically. By an ironical method of speech he suggested that the voices of such prophets were not to be accepted as truth. He knew well enough God&#146;s living voice. In the silence and solitude of his prison, shut away from all the world besides, he had learned to detect the accent of truth, and could easily discriminate between it and the lying boasts of the false prophets. We must try the spirits, whether they are of God, <ref>1Jn 4:1</ref>. Beware of being beguiled by every voice that speaks in your heart.

There is no such thing as chance in this world. The bird does not fall to the ground, the arrow does not find its way to the heart, without a superintending Providence.

In the interests of the whole nation, this insult could not be passed over in silence, and at God&#146;s bidding Elijah appeared upon the scene. He rebuked the messengers for their idolatrous quest and told them that the king would surely die. They returned with the report that a man clad in a hairy garment had met them, and had said that the king would not recover. It was enough.

The servant of Jehovah had no right to say to such a man, &#147;I am as thou art,&#148; etc. He had said this before, and narrowly escaped with his life.

She usurped the throne, and played in Judah the part of her mother Jezebel. Joram was a wicked man and a bad king, but he recognized the value of piety, and chose the good priest Jehoiada as the husband of his daughter. The husband neutralized the evil influences of his wife&#146;s upbringing and led her into a noble and useful career, the chief episode of which was the rescue of the youngest son of Ahaziah. His nurse and he were hidden in a room where the mattresses were kept in case of a sudden influx of priests at festal times. Is not this hidden king a type of the hiding of the true Prince in the recesses of our hearts, while some Athaliah occupies too large a share of government? There is no alternative but that the evil self-life, our Athaliah, should be stoned.</p><p>It was a glad moment when the hidden prince was produced.

A change was therefore required, and their receipts were limited to the sin-offerings. As soon as a clear chance was given to the people, their free-will gifts totaled a large amount, which justified the resumption of the work. Certainly the promptness and integrity of the men who did the work put to shame the lethargy and peculation of the priests. Trust the people!

It is small wonder that the king&#146;s heart misgave him when he compared the divine ideal with the actual condition of things in Judah and Jerusalem.

First, his imminent danger from inrushing waters and the deep mire like that in which Jeremiah sank. There are also failing strength, the dried throat, and the drooping eyes. Mighty foes, too, who hate wrongfully, are plotting his ruin. The consciousness of sin and the dread that others may be made ashamed through his failure, are also bitter ingredients in his cup. And in addition he bore the reproach of those who hated God. What a combination of misery! In some, though not in all, of these sources of grief, our Savior had a share, and therefore He can be a sympathizing High Priest.</p><p>But out of his misery the psalmist builds his altar of prayer. His plea is in God&#146;s loving-kindness and tender mercies. Here is the master-argument with God. He can do no other than redeem the soul that clings to Him with such unfaltering faith. It reminds us of the olden resolve, &#147;Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him,&#148; <ref><reflink target=\"Job 13:15\">Job 13:15</reflink></ref>, and also recalls the persistence of the Syrophenician woman, <ref><reflink target=\"Mar 7:26\">Mar 7:26</reflink></ref>.

The enduring heavens, the mightiest natural forces, such as the tides, the glorious mountains, are emblems of qualities in God&#146;s nature.

            "1": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>THE CRY OF THE AFFLICTED </b></p><p>This is the fifth of the Penitential Psalms. Some hold that it is one of the later psalms, asking for deliverance from captivity; others, emphasizing certain Davidic characteristics, ascribe it to the hand of the royal psalmist. Its actual authorship, however, is of comparatively small consequence; the main thing is to notice what adequate expression it gives to the sorrow of an almost broken heart.</p><p>The psalmist bases his cry for a speedy answer on the swiftness with which his days are passing away, like smoke escaping, from a chimney. His bones are calcined; his heart withers like Jonah&#146;s gourd; he is worn to a skeleton by his long and passionate lamentations. He finds his likeness in solitude-loving creatures, such as the pelican and the owl. Still another element in his suffering is the mockery of his foes. He cannot get away from it; it haunts him. Ashes, the token of his mourning, are his food, and tears fill his cup. But the bitterest element of all is the consciousness of God&#146;s displeasure. It seems as if God&#146;s hand is against him, and in the accumulated weight of grief, he deems that the day of his life must expire. However, in the concluding portion of the psalm his hope is renewed.</p>",
            "12": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>THE TIME TO HAVE MERCY UPON ZION </b></p><p>We must remember that the Holy Spirit appropriates the closing words of this psalm as addressed to our Lord. See <ref><reflink target=\"Heb 1:10\">Heb 1:10</reflink>-12</ref>. This gives new point to these petitions. The psalmist&#146;s sorrows, described in the previous paragraph, had their source in the desolations of Zion rather than in personal afflictions; and when the soul feels such oppression, it is a sign that deliverance is near. Finney, the great evangelist, tells of a woman who came to her pastor under such concern for the perishing that she could neither eat nor sleep. She entreated him to appoint an inquirers&#146; meeting, and though there had been no signs of a revival, it suddenly broke out. When Christians take pity on the stones and dust of the Church, the time has come for God to arise to her help.</p><p>Behold the unchanging Christ! Creation may wax old, the heavens and earth may be laid aside as an outworn garment, the old order may give place to new; but beneath all the changed Jesus Christ remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. How delightful are those immortal words, <i>But thou, O Lord, shalt endure</i>, and if He endures, His servants shall continue also, and their children after them.</p>"

Notice the present tenses throughout these verses. God&#146;s tender dealings run parallel with our lives. He is never weary nor exhausted. When once He begins, He keeps on. Let us enumerate the blessings that He gives in such unbroken abundance, and as the fingers tell the successive beads, praise Him: forgiveness; healing, <ref><reflink target=\"Exo 15:26\">Exo 15:26</reflink></ref>; redemption from perils and accidents, seen and unseen; the crowns that He places on our unworthy heads; entire satisfaction, <ref><reflink target=\"Psa 36:8\">Psa 36:8</reflink></ref>; <ref><reflink target=\"Isa 58:11\">Isa 58:11</reflink></ref>; perennial youth.</p><p>It was a proverb among Orientals that the eagle literally grows younger. This is the psalmist&#146;s reference in <ref>Psa 103:5</ref>. For us it means that the life which is fed from the eternal springs is eagle-like in royal strength and sunward flight. <i>Ways</i> or plans are revealed to the inner circle; the ordinary congregation knows only <i>acts</i>. The Father does chide, but only till we put sin away. Conceive the infinite spaces of East and West-such is the distance of forgiven sin from us. It is impossible that the blame or curse of it should ever return upon the redeemed soul.</p>",
            "13": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>EVERLASTING LOVING-KINDNESS </b></p><p>The psalmist comes from the far-reaching sky to the homely image of a father&#146;s pity. God is a great King, the mighty Creator, but the Spirit witnesses that we are His <i>children</i> and teaches us to say, <i>Abba, Father</i>. The idea of <i>dust</i> is that of frailty. Made of dust and fragile as an earthen vessel, man by his weakness appeals to Jehovah&#146;s compassion. The thought of frailty and helplessness is still further impressed by the figure of the fading flower, scorched by the hot desert wind. But, by force of contrast, the psalmist passes from man&#146;s brief span of life to God&#146;s eternal years. And God&#146;s love is as His life. Because God is eternal, His love is eternal. When once He loves, He loves always; He never wearies, never cools, and never lets go. A parent who fears God may leave a legacy of priceless worth to his children&#146;s children. See <ref>Psa 103:17</ref>.</p><p>From <ref>Psa 103:19</ref> to the end, the psalmist pulls out all the stops in the great organ of existence. Angels and hosts of other intelligent beings who perform the Lord&#146;s will, all his works animate and inanimate, all saints, all souls, stars and suns, oceans, and mountains-<i>all</i> must join the &#147;Hallelujah Chorus.&#148;</p>"

God is very great, because He created the heavens and the earth. He is clothed with honor and majesty, and yet He stooped to brood over the chaos and darkness which preceded the order and beauty of our earth. When He said, &#147;Let there be light,&#148; He robed Himself in its texture. The firmament of <ref><reflink target=\"Gen 1:8\">Gen 1:8</reflink></ref> was the curtain of his tent. The clouds above and the seas beneath yielded his chariot and hid for Him the joists of His palace. See <ref><reflink target=\"Gen 1:9\">Gen 1:9</reflink>-10</ref>. Compare <ref>Psa 103:4</ref> and <ref><reflink target=\"Heb 1:7\">Heb 1:7</reflink></ref>.</p><p>The psalmist in <ref>Psa 104:6</ref> seems to see the process which is described briefly and graphically in <ref><reflink target=\"Gen 1:10\">Gen 1:10</reflink></ref>. The waters had covered the world with their storm and welter; but at God&#146;s command they poured down the mountain slopes to the ocean bed, there to be retained by banks of sand. What exquisite thoughtfulness is disclosed in God&#146;s provision of the springs! He thinks for the wild asses and the fowls, and how much more will He care for you, O ye of little faith!</p>",
            "13": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>A HABITATION FOR BEAST AND MAN </b></p><p>Where there is true love for God, there will be a glad and rejoicing heart that takes pleasure in the study of His works. The loving child of a great artist lingers about his studio, watches with eager interest the development of picture or statue, and speaks with delight to others of her father&#146;s work. It is in such a spirit that those who know God in daily fellowship and communion follow the psalmist to mountain streams, to the pastures and the meadows, the grain-fields and the orchards, the high mountains with their dark pines and firs.</p><p>There is no pen that has more eloquently portrayed these scenes than Ruskin&#146;s. He had a natural love for beauty, and an unrivaled genius for vivid description; but it was as a boy at his mother&#146;s knee that he learned from these Scriptures to connect the glories of the natural world with the devout adoration of the Creator. His books reflect this early training.</p><p>This psalm may be called a divine commentary on God&#146;s earliest book-the world which lies around us.</p>",
            "24": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>THE ALMIGHTY&#146;S OPEN HAND </b></p><p>The psalmist says nothing of the operation of the great laws of nature, but passes behind and beyond to the Great Hand which opens to fill and satisfy all living things with good. The personality of God is the moving force behind the thin veil of outward appearance. This is in striking contrast with much of the thinking and speaking of the present day, which practically exclude the Creator from his own creation. But there is no real opposition between the two conceptions. Natural law is only another way of stating the usual method of God&#146;s working. There is no variableness in Him, nor shadow cast by turning; and it is because we can count on His unaltering methods that human life can develop regularly and successfully.</p><p>While all creation waits on the opening of God&#146;s hand, man alone can adore Him. We stand in the midst of creation as its high priest and interpreter. We can say to God what nature longs to express but cannot. Amid the beauty and magnificence of natural scenery, let us sing the &#147;Te Deum;&#148; and let us believe that He who rejoices in His works comes very near us in our joy, which proves that our nature and His are closely akin.</p>"

They are evidently derived in part from the old Tabernacle service, in which is found the beginning of this psalm and the end of the next, <ref><reflink target=\"1Ch 16:1\">1Ch 16:1</reflink>-43</ref>. Here we have the story of Jehovah&#146;s faithfulness to his Covenant and of Israel&#146;s ingratitude.</p><p>It is right to make known God&#146;s doings. Nothing touches men more quickly, or excites faith and hope more certainly, than to hear what others have experienced of God&#146;s saving health. Let us talk more often of His marvelous works. If God has forgiven you, even to ten thousand talents, confess it. If you have learned more of Christ&#146;s patience in His bearing with your sins and failures, tell it out. The salient points which stand out in our record of the past may be summarized under the same general headings as those of the psalmist. God has been mindful of His Covenant, ratified by the blood of his Son. He has shown his independence of human standards in choosing us, though we are absolutely unworthy to inherit His Kingdom. How often He has interposed in our behalf even when we have deserved the worst, saying, <i>Touch not mine anointed</i>!</p>",
            "16": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>WONDERS IN EGYPT </b></p><p>The psalmist retells the story of Joseph, as a link in the chain of providences which secured the fulfillment of the Covenant. It may be that it was also introduced to comfort Israel amid the afflictions of the Captivity. Another reading of the second clause of <ref>Psa 105:18</ref> is, &#147;The iron entered his soul.&#148; This is what pain does for us all; it puts iron into our blood. In <ref>Psa 105:19</ref> we learn that God&#146;s promise, while unfulfilled and apparently contradicted by present facts, serves as a test of a man&#146;s reliance upon God. It brings into clear relief his unwavering faith. Joseph was tested and not found wanting.</p><p>In <ref>Psa 105:23-27</ref> carry us a step farther in the unfolding of God&#146;s purpose. The sojourn in Egypt, with its terrible hardships and the trouble that befell the tyrant, is quoted with direct reference to the action and interposition of the Almighty. The psalmist sees only one hand at work. He does not hesitate to ascribe to God even, the hatred which the Egyptians entertained toward Israel, and which, in Pharaoh&#146;s case, meant the hardening of his heart. Such is the inevitable effect when man&#146;s pride conflicts with divine tenderness and love. Let us believe that God is in all the incidents of our daily life and of human history.</p>",

The tenth plague, <ref>Psa 105:36</ref>, is followed by the triumphant exodus, when Israel went forth, enriched with treasure and strong for the march. However sad and weary our life may be, it will one day be rich and strong as it goes forth to serve under new and loftier conditions. How good it is to realize that God hath prepared for us things that surpass human thought, and which are proportioned not according to intellect but according to heart; not according to deeds but according to character!</p><p>God is all-sufficient for us. He was everything that Israel needed. Can He not suffice for us? We have good hope, not because of our deserts, but because of the covenant into which He has entered with our Savior, who is our Representative and Federal Head. Not for <i>our</i> sakes, but for His holy Name&#146;s sake, God has pledged Himself to make us His heirs, joint-heirs with His Son, and sharers in all that joy and bliss which await us on the other side. Ought we not, then, to love Him and to keep His statutes and laws? Hallelujah!</p>"

These verses record some of its phases. Moses is called God&#146;s chosen, Aaron his saint, while Phinehas is held in honor as one to whom his noble deed was counted for righteousness. But such men are always envied, refused, resisted. Men hate them, but God loves and vindicates them for their loyalty and uncompromising righteousness.</p><p>It is beautiful to notice how, so far from human hatred inducing such leaders to turn from their persecutors, it seems to drive them to more intense and ceaseless intercession for them. They stand in the breach, to turn away deserved wrath. From the days of Abraham, who prayed for Sodom, right down the stream of time, the people of God have been his remembrancers, giving Him no rest. Let us cultivate the great art of intercession; and if there is need, let us, like Phinehas, not hesitate to strike strongly in the interests of purity. But while thus standing before men, we must cultivate the grace of humility. We are only servants at the most and must not arrogate more to ourselves. Our authority is only delegated. This is where Moses failed, <ref><reflink target=\"Num 20:2\">Num 20:2</reflink>-13</ref>.</p>",

Intermarriage poured a large admixture of alien blood into Israel, and the excesses of idolatry, even to the hideous practice of human sacrifices, became intensified by the ties of kinship and neighborhood.</p><p>The whole history of Israel is summed up as alternating cycles of sin and punishment, repentance and deliverance; and we are left wondering, first at the inveterate evil of the human heart, which learns nothing from experience, and next at the inexhaustible long-suffering of God, which, while justice strikes, yet finds some way of alleviating the smart of the stroke, <ref>Psa 106:46</ref>.

There is always the saving help of His right hand; and there is always, therefore, the obligation of praise.</p><p>The first scene is of a caravan in the desert, with depleted water-skins, emptied stores, and exhausted strength.

Men ruin their health by evil courses, and the sinner drags down his punishment with his own hands. The portals of death had already opened to receive the sick men, but before they passed through they cried to Jehovah, and though their voice was feeble, they were heard.

Lands pass from fertility to barrenness, and human lives from prosperity to trouble, and back again. But through all these vicissitudes runs the same loving-kindness, as is clearly discerned by those who have eyes to see and hearts to take heed. How little did Joseph&#146;s brethren realize that behind all the strange experiences they had with his steward, in his house, and in the matter of the cup, a brother&#146;s heart was yearning to reach a moment when all disguise might be laid aside!

They are the work of an unknown minstrel, but anonymity is characteristic of the highest work.

At this point the procession reaches the Temple gates. <ref>Psa 118:20</ref> is the response of priests and Levites, the custodians of the sacred edifice, who lay stress on the character of those who tread its courts. <ref>Psa 118:21</ref>, the soloist; <ref>Psa 118:22-27</ref>, the full chorus; <ref>Psa 118:28</ref>, the soloist; <ref>Psa 118:29</ref>, the concluding doxology.</p><p>Luther says of this psalm: &#147;This is mine, the one which I love.&#148; As it was included in the great Hallel we infer that our Lord sang it as He went forth to die, <ref><reflink target=\"Mat 26:30\">Mat 26:30</reflink></ref>.

Probably if we were to substitute <i>Will</i> for <i>Word</i> we should not be far wrong. The earnest desire of the writer was that his will should be brought into blessed and unbroken union with the divine purpose in his life.</p><p>In its structure the psalm is an elaborate acrostic. In the original, each verse in a given section begins with the same letter, so that the twenty-two sections present the complete Hebrew alphabet.</p><p>It needs to be often used to be understood and valued. Chrysostom, Ambrose, Augustine, and Luther have left on record high tributes to its worth. There are several key expressions, which recur again and again, such as <i>quicken</i> and <i>teach me thy statutes.</i> It is interesting, also, to construct the psalmist&#146;s biography from his confessions. He had gone astray like a lost sheep, was small and despised, had many adversaries, was like a bottle in the smoke; but he accounted God&#146;s will and service more than food or gold, and his one desire was to be taught to do that will.</p>",

The soul breaks for longing, cleaves to the dust, and melts for heaviness. We are reminded of the complaint of a godly man, uttered two centuries and a half ago: &#147;If God had not said, &#145;Blessed are those that hunger,&#146; I know not what could keep weak Christians from sinking into despair. Many times all I can do is to complain that I want Him and wish to recover Him.&#148;</p><p>We learn from this psalm to pour out before God such desires. If we can do nothing else, we can complain that we are lacking in relish, in the sense of His nearness, and in the comfort of holy prayer. The expression of desire for God is prayer, which He accepts and will answer. &#147;He will fulfill <i>the desire of</i> them that fear Him; He also will hear their cry, and will save them,&#148; <ref>Psa 145:19</ref>. When the father of the prodigal first saw him, he was a long way off, but love could not wait till the son had traversed that intervening distance. He ran to meet him, and kissed him, while the words of confession were trembling on his lips. So God will draw near to quicken, strengthen, teach, and cause us to understand. Then we shall run where now we limp.</p>",

If you look cursorily at a great painting, you will fail to become enthralled with it. In the Dresden gallery connoisseurs will spend hours before a single painting by Raphael. They go away, and return the next day. They make the painting their own by prolonged communion with its matchless forms. One of them said: &#147;I could spend an hour every day, for years, upon that assemblage of human, angelic, and divine ideals, and on the last day of the last year discover some new beauty and a new joy.&#148; But what thoughts, what ideals, can genius express in a painting which can be compared with those great thoughts of God, of heaven, and of eternity, which are given on the page of Scripture. Surely we cannot hope to spring into possession of such thoughts in less time than lovers of art spend on a masterpiece! We must meditate!</p>",

Often prayer clears itself as it proceeds. It is the repeated testimony of all who have become proficient in the art of prayer that the seasons which begin with a struggle against depression, gloom, and the sense of absence, end in triumphant joy. Jeremy Taylor puts it thus: &#147;So have I seen a lark rising from his bed of grass and soaring upward, singing as he rises, and hoping to get to heaven and climb above the clouds; but the poor bird was beaten back by the loud sighings of an eastern wind, his motion became inconstant and irregular, till the little creature was forced to sit down and pant, and stay till the storm was over; and then it made a prosperous flight, and did rise and sing, as if it had learned music and motion from an angel, as he was passing through the air about his ministries of mercy.&#148;</p>",

Here is the far-off interest of our tears. God measures out our sorrows and the trials which cause them. But our condition requires the stern and bitter regimen. The stone must be cut by the lapidary. The heavy clouds, with their drenching showers, must hang over the landscape. The fire must cleanse the metal. If need be, ye suffer heaviness through many temptations. Yes, there is a <i>need-be</i>, and only <i>if</i> need be, for He doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. It is His strange work, <ref><reflink target=\"Isa 28:21\">Isa 28:21</reflink></ref>. The very least and the very greatest sorrows that befall us are provided, or permitted, by his unspeakable love. If we be without chastisement, whereof all children are partakers, then are we bastard and not sons, <ref><reflink target=\"Heb 12:8\">Heb 12:8</reflink></ref>. But amid the affliction, his loving-kindness always waits upon our comfort, <ref>Psa 119:76</ref>. &#147;God, that comforteth those that are cast down,&#148; says the Apostle, &#147;comforted us by the coming of Titus,&#148; <ref><reflink target=\"2Co 7:6\">2Co 7:6</reflink></ref>.</p>",

Our parents, teachers, ministers, all insist on the truth of Scripture and the certainty of the facts which it reveals; but as life goes on we change our foundations and advance to the personal and experimental conviction which has been wrought in us by years of testing the Word of God for ourselves.</p><p>The famous Scotch clergyman, Thomas Erskine, said that no demolition of outward authority, even if such demolition were possible, could deprive him of the conviction of the divine origin and authority of the Bible, because it so exactly coincided with the experiences of his life, and had been verified in so many remarkable instances.

But this is not to be wondered at, because love is so quick and unerring in its intuitions. They who love, know. We have two organs of knowledge the head and the heart. The latter is the swifter and truer of the two; and it lies open to love, human and divine, as the lyre to the musician&#146;s hand. The study of God&#146;s Word by a loving heart gives, to simple and unlearned people, an understanding which no college learning can impart. They have a lamp that lights them unerringly on the devious tracks of this mortal life.</p><p>There is also this advantage: the soul which is deeply instructed in God&#146;s Word hates every false way. It is not simply warned against taking it; it does not want to take it. A distaste for sin is the result of Bible love and Bible study.

The psalmist acknowledges his simplicity; is quite content to be among the unknown and despised of men. He is very anxious to be free from iniquity and transgression. He sheds bitter tears as he beholds the sin around him. He humbly asks only to be remembered, taught, and cared for. Nothing is left to him but what is God&#146;s or of God. God is his own desire, God&#146;s Word his stay and comfort, God&#146;s love his solace. God is the one goal and purpose of his search.</p><p>And his whole nature glows with love. He opens his mouth and pants with pure desire for God. He wants only that face to shine which fills heaven with brightness. The very purity of the Word only stirs again the embers of his true affection. He is one, therefore, with all the saints of every age, for humble, meek, merciful, and loving souls are everywhere of one religion; and when death has taken off the mask, as William Penn put it, they will know one another, though the divers liveries they wear here make them strangers.</p>",

He calls with his whole heart; he awakes before the dawn and continues long after the fall of night; he asks that his case may be considered, his cause pleaded, and his soul quickened. When we draw near to God in prayer, our prayers must not be vague or languid. Jeremy Taylor says: &#147;Easiness of desire is a great enemy to the success of a good man&#146;s prayer. It must be an intent, zealous, busy, operative prayer. For consider what a huge indecency it is that a man should speak to God for a thing that he values not. Our prayers upbraid our spirits when we beg tamely for those things for which we ought to die.&#148; But when we pray after the manner of the psalmist, we become aware that God is near. <i>Thou art nigh, O Jehovah</i>, <ref>Psa 119:151</ref>, R.V.

We eat and drink and sleep; we read and meditate; we walk in the pleasant fields of nature. We have our homes, our loved ones, the respect and good-will of many. But, above all, we have God, and His Word, our eternal hope, and blessed foretastes of the heaven that is to be. Surely we should be less peevish and morose! We should rejoice in every good thing that the Lord our God gives us. We should take the cup brimming with salvation and praise His holy Name. &#147;He that hath so many causes of joy must be very much in love with sorrow, who chooses to turn aside and sit upon his little handful of thorns.&#148; And is not this the most wonderful of all, that though we were going astray like lost sheep, the Great Shepherd Himself came to seek and to save? <i>Te Deum Laudamus!</i></p>"

He will not tolerate the intervention of second causes, which are the artifice of scientific explanation. Laws are, after all, only the convenient statement of the regularity of God&#146;s methods.

He is equally at home in the hospital where broken hearts congregate, and among the stars, which He names and counts as a shepherd His flock. He upholds the meek and overthrows the proud. Spring, with its clouds and rain and sprouting grass, is His work; but so also the wild life of the forest, with its beasts and birds. He has no such delight in athletic strength or speed as He has in the reverent worship of His people. There is a perfect balance and rhythm in God&#146;s nature.</p>",

Are we strengthened against temptation, as a city with bars and bolts, blessed with peace, and filled with the fine flour of gospel truth? It is because He hath so appointed it by His commandment and swiftly-running word. Is it winter, the air full of blinding snowflakes; rime everywhere, as if the frost-king had powdered the earth and bound the waters with His chain? Be of good cheer; God is in it all. Winter is needed to pulverize the soil; but as soon as it has done its necessary work, the warm breath of His manifested love will breathe over desolations, and all the frost and snow will hasten to be gone. Will God give so much thought to garnishing the home in which His children live and neglect them?

It is a clear and concise statement of the points at issue between Jehovah and His people. Special urgency was given to these appeals, when first uttered, from the fact which was well-known to the Hebrew politicians and people, that Assyria was preparing for a great war of conquest, which would be directed specially against Jerusalem and her allies. This chapter is east in the form of an assize, a crown case in which God is both complainant and judge. The conviction of sinfulness which the prophet desired to secure, was sought, not by appealing to a code of laws which had been transgressed, but by showing the ingratitude with which Israel had repaid the fatherly love of God. It is the personal element in sin that most quickly convicts men. &#147;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&#148; &#147;Thou art the man!&#148; &#147;He hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace!&#148;</p>",

What may be called personal and private sins, such as drunkenness, vanity, bribery, and the oppression of the poor, are viewed in their public hearing, as bringing wrath and disaster on the whole nation. No man can sin by himself. His most private sins react on the whole community. Thistle-down floats far and wide. In reply, the nation pointed to the splendid ritual and innumerable sacrifices of the Temple service. But these observances only added to the tale of their sins, because they were formal and perfunctory. The sacrifice of God is a broken and contrite heart. The outward is absolutely worthless, unless it is the expression of the inward and the spiritual. But where a pure and holy spirit is present, the simplest forms are magnificent in their significance and value. To atone becomes the base of a ladder to heaven, and the thorn-bush flames with Deity. But forgiveness is freely offered to the guilty. Crimson and scarlet are the most lasting of all colors, and their removal impresses the completeness of God&#146;s pardoning love.</p>",

In answer to the argument of the Jews, who demanded a plurality of wives, Malachi says that God originally made only one woman for one man, though He could have made many.

They could not discern the divine in the human, the heavenly under the earthly veil. The Savior, therefore, driven from their towns, goes about among the villages, depriving Himself of the companionship of His disciples, in order to spread the good news as far as possible. The Lord is still in His Church through the Holy Spirit, but His power is limited and neutralized by our unbelief. It is useless to ask Him to put forth His great power and save us, so long as we have made it practically impossible for Him to do as we ask. The oldtime cry was: &#147;Why shouldst thou be as a mighty man that cannot save?&#148; The answer is supplied here: <i>He could do no</i> <i>mighty work,&#133; and he marveled at their unbelief.</i> Faith is our capacity for God, and there are several conditions for its nurture and growth.</p><p>With what simplicity the Twelve were started on their mission, <ref><reflink target=\"Mar 6:7\">Mar 6:7</reflink></ref>. But with what authority they spoke! Simplicity and power are closely allied. The truly strong soul is not in need of the external surroundings and circumstances on which others lean; and in proportion to our willingness to deprive ourselves of the sources of human confidence may we lay hold on and possess divine power.</p>",
            "21": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>MARTYRDOM OF A WITNESS-BEARER </b></p><p>Better the dungeon with John than the palace with Herod, for conscience filled the palace with the ghost of the murdered Baptist! A woman brought Herod to that. How careful women should be of the influence they exert over men; how careful men should be of yielding to any but the noblest influence! This family was eaten with lust, usually coupled with cruelty. No vice ever dwells alone. John the Baptist had a brief and tortuous career; for a few months the central figure of the nation, and then hurled down into the darkness of the dungeon, like some extinguished torch. No wonder that his specter haunted the heart of Herod, who thought that in Jesus he had become reincarnate. The messenger may fall, but the message is taken up and passed on by a thousand lips. Notice the contrast between John&#146;s end and that of our Lord. In John&#146;s case the disciples who had hearkened to his every word dispersed. The head had fallen, and the members were scattered. None thought of proclaiming their departed leader as still the living head and center of the movement he had set on foot. But when our Lord died, His true influence over men began. Up to that time he had been the Jewish rabbi; thenceforward he became the Redeemer of the world.</p>",
            "30": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>THE SYMPATHY AND COMPASSION OF JESUS </b></p><p>When the Apostles returned they had much to tell. Some were flushed with success, others radiant with victory over demons, others, perhaps, overstrained and weary, and all needing the quiet, holy influence of repose and silence in the Lord&#146;s company. And in those quiet hours or days, as the fever passed out of them, He taught them memorable lessons of how He would feed the world by His Church, and how His people would be safe amid the storms that swept the sea, for always he would watch them from the height, and come to them at the moment when His help was most needed. Christ sits as host at the great table of the Church, and the meager resources of His servants yield the starting point for His multiplication of bread. He bids us go and consider how little we have, that we may properly estimate the greatness of His help. Notice how the upward look precedes the breaking and giving. There is enough for each, not of bread alone, but of fish; and the disciples are refreshed by another kind of ministry. So the Lord recreates us by turning exhausted energies into new channels. What threatens to overpower us brings Christ to our side. But His footsteps must be arrested, if we would have His company. Where Jesus is, storms cease and the sick are made whole.</p>"

They followed endless rules, both intricate and troublesome, as to ablutions and outward ceremonials. So long as their devotees were careful in the minor observances, they were permitted a wide license so far as the weightier matters of the Law were concerned. This is a natural tendency of the human heart. It is glad to be able to reduce its religious life to an outward and literal obedience, if only its thoughts may be unhampered. In the life of true holiness everything depends on the control of the thoughts. &#147;As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.&#148; With infinite wisdom the wise man said, &#147;Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life,&#148; and Jesus put &#147;evil-thoughts&#148; first in the black category of the contents of the evil heart. A gang of thieves sometimes put a very small boy through a tiny window that he may unlock the front door. So one evil thought will often admit an entire crew of evil. Heart of mine, hast thou learned this lesson? Art thou careful enough of thy cleanliness? That the hands should be often washed, that vessels of household use should be kept cleansed, that there should be decorum and neatness in the outward life, all these customs are good. But it becomes thee to inquire whether thou art not more eager for the outward than the inward cleanliness. &#147;Create in me a clean heart,&#148; should be thy constant prayer.</p>",

His mission at that time was to the Jewish people; they were the <i>children.</i> This woman had no claim as a child, and the question was whether she was prepared to take the lower place. It is the humble soul that has power with God, and when she showed herself prepared to put Jesus in His place as Lord, and to take her own place as willing to accept the children&#146;s crumbs, the Lord was able to put the key of His treasure house into her hand and bid her have her desire. Faith can wring blessing from an apparent negative, and use what might seem to be a rebuff to open God&#146;s treasuries.</p><p>In the following miracle, notice that upward look, that sigh, and that touch. These are the conditions of all successful religious work, and it is a great encouragement to faith that our Lord Himself knew what it was by a look to draw down the mighty power of God. That upward look may be ours when it is impossible to kneel for prolonged prayer. When we stand in the light of eternity, we also shall say, as our Lord&#146;s contemporaries did, &#147;He hath done all things well.&#148;</p>"

Having sighed over the hard-heartedness of the Pharisees, might He not equally have done so over the obtuseness of the Twelve? They thought that He was referring to their carelessness in omitting to take bread. How little they realized that the cause lay far deeper!

Here we see through a glass darkly, there face to face. There was a great price to be paid; it was only through suffering and death that Jesus could do His greatest work, in redeeming and cleansing the children of men. He might have been the miracle-worker apart from Calvary; but to be the Savior, He must not spare Himself but be willing to pour out His soul even unto death. It was hard for the Apostles to learn this lesson; they wanted the Master to spare Himself. Peter, especially, sought to dissuade Him; but the Lord knew better the desperate need of men and how it must be met. There are three conditions to be fulfilled by those who have resolved to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. 1. <i>We must deny self;</i> 2<i>. Each must take up his cross;</i> 3. <i>We must think more of others than of ourselves.</i> If these are realized, the soul is following Christ and making progress, even though it deems itself stagnant or drifting back.</p>"

The transfiguring light that shone from our Lord&#146;s face differed from the shining of Moses&#146; face. With Moses the light was from without, and faded; but with Christ the light shone from within. Surely at that moment He might have stepped back into heaven by the open door, through which the representatives of the Law and the prophets had come; but He turned His back on the joy of the Father&#146;s home, and set His face to endure the cross, that He might become, not the example only, but the Redeemer of men. What a contrast between that scene on Hermon&#146;s slopes, where the glory of Jesus was brighter than the glistening snows about Him, and that below, where the demoniac child writhed in pain! Raphael does well to group these two incidents in one picture, for we are shown here that the duty of the Church is not to build tabernacles on the mount of vision, but to take her way into the haunts of crime and misery and cope with the power of Satan. Faith is the channel through which the divine power passes. Its quantity is of less importance than its quality. It may be minute as a mustard seed, but, like it, must contain the principle of life.</p>",

Jesus therefore took a little child for His text, and preached to them a sermon on humility. How constantly the Master speaks of the little ones! He says that we must be converted to become like them; that to cause them to stumble will involve terrible penalties; that they are not to be despised; that each has an angel of the Father&#146;s presence-chamber appointed to his charge; that to seek and to save one He is prepared as the shepherd to traverse the mountains; that it is not the Father&#146;s will that one of them should perish.

It is not necessary that all should sell their goods, and give away the proceeds; indeed, it is often harder to retain and administer them rightly for God. But it was necessary for Christ to prove to this young man that he was not living the life of love, as he seemed to suppose.

As speech reveals the hidden thoughts of men, so does our Lord utter the unseen God. God spake and it was done. His words preceded the act of creation, but Christ was the Word or utterance of God. He who created time preceded time, and that which is before time is eternal and divine. Christ is the organ or medium by which God goes forth in creation, providence, and redemption. The life of God was stored in the human nature of Jesus, when the Word became flesh, that it might more readily pass into us. True life is always light, as the minute <i>infusoria</i> of the ocean are phosphorescent. When we receive Christ&#146;s life, we shine.</p><p>Men are still sent from God, as John was, to bear witness to Jesus; but there is also a witness to Him in the breast of man. We call it conscience, or the inner light. The blinded world knew Him not.

Evidently Jesus had existed before this becoming; and evidently there was a process of self-limitation. <i>Dwelt,</i> that is, tabernacled. As the Shechinah light was veiled by the curtain of the Tabernacle, so the divine essence in Jesus was veiled by His humanity, though it shone out at the Transfiguration. He was full of <i>grace,</i> the unmerited love of God; full of <i>truth,</i> coming to bear witness to it; full of <i>glory,</i> that of the only begotten Son. There are many sons, but only one Son.</p><p>What a beautiful testimony John the Baptist gave! He was not the Christ, not Elijah (except in spirit), not the expected prophet, but just a voice, announcing the Christ and dying away. He was content to decrease before the greater whom he had been taught to expect and was sent to herald. There is a sense in which the preacher of repentance must always precede the Christ. There must be a putting away of known sin, previous to the recognition of the Lamb of God. But how great must Christ be, when so noble a man as the Baptist felt unworthy to unloose His sandals!</p>",

This, however, was not the case. John had been previously informed that some day one, indicated by those signs, would come to His baptism. John was the porter of the door of the fold, and it was necessary to certify the true Shepherd when He appeared, <ref><reflink target=\"Joh 10:3\">Joh 10:3</reflink></ref>.

He intended to transfer their allegiance from himself to the Lord. Henceforth they were to behold <i>Him.</i> So, at least, they understood it. We are told that they followed Jesus. As the preacher watched their retreating figures and realized that His work was done, he had no feeling of jealousy or regret.

Others were brought by the Master&#146;s direct personal influence-<i>he findeth Philip.</i> Still others were brought by the call and ties of friendship, following on a long course of previous preparation. Philip had often crossed the hills that separated the Lake from Cana, where Nathanael dwelt, and the two would earnestly discuss the signs of the time: the desperate straits of their country, the preaching of the Baptist, and the Messiah&#146;s advent. The guileless Israelite would sit beneath his favorite fig-tree, pondering over the things which Moses and the prophets had written.

The wine had to fail, as the earthly and human always must, in order to make room for the eternal and divine. Like Mary, we are impetuous, and would hasten the divine actions: but God is ever deliberate and waits for the exact hour before He interposes. It is hardly likely that our Lord made one hundred and thirty gallons of wine; but that as the servants drew and bore to the table, the wondrous change was wrought. Our Lord did in a moment what He is ever doing, transforming dews and rain into the nutritive and gladdening juices of nature.</p><p>Here was indeed a sign that the Master desired to sweeten and enhance human happiness, and that His influence could transform what was ordinary and common into the joyous and sacramental.

He was willing to talk about systems of truth and schemes of philosophy; but the Master knew that more, much more, was necessary; there must be the emergence of His soul into the experience of an enlarged and fuller life. The phrase, &#147;the new birth,&#148; the Jews always used for Gentiles, and it greatly startled Nicodemus to learn that there was needed for himself the same change as was required by Gentiles before entering the Jewish commonwealth. In speaking of water, our Lord probably refers to the baptism of John, in which men confessed their sins and expressed their desire to leave the past behind and to enter a fuller experience of the life of God. The new life begotten by the Spirit of God is as mysterious as the wind.

But the Baptist had no sense of being aggrieved. His answer is one of the noblest ever made by human lips: &#147;My work has been definitely assigned to me. It has been enough for me to fulfill it.

The woman evaded the sword thrust, but she realized that she was dealing with a master hand in the spiritual realm. Hence her question about worship. This led to one of the greatest sayings ever uttered on earth-that God is Spirit; that He is ever searching for true worshipers; and that He is indifferent to places and nationalities and method, that we cannot worship until we live in the spirit-realm and are willing to conform ourselves absolutely to truth-these thoughts have revolutionized the religious thinking of mankind.

The whiteness of the harvest appeared in the crowds that were coming down the valley; but at harvest time we are sometimes apt to forget the sower who passed home without seeing the result of his labor.

He also chose the incidents which led to our Lord&#146;s discourses, and served as the text of his words.</p><p>The pool of Bethesda had medicinal properties. It was an intermittent spring.

The religious leaders of that time, like those of all time, could not tolerate the setting up of an authority superior to their own, by one who was outside their ranks; and they accused Jesus of Sabbath-breaking. His judges, however, were little prepared for His line of defense, which revealed the depths of our Lord&#146;s inner consciousness. First, He spoke of God as His own Father, making Himself God&#146;s equal. See <ref>Php 2:6</ref>. Second, He said that God was working through His life and had energized Him to perform that miracle of healing. It was not His own deed but the Father&#146;s in Him and through Him.

There is also this other truth, that each of us is called to exercise toward Christ the same attitude and dependence that He exercised toward the Father. It is impossible by one illustration to set forth the eternal facts of the spiritual world. Metaphor has to be heaped on metaphor.

Our Lord, therefore, describes the bread of the soul-life as His <i>flesh,</i> which he would give for the life of the world. Obviously <i>flesh</i> is that which has passed through death.

The wrong under which man bled wrought in Him an anger which was without sin. He still stands among our groups of mourners, touched with the feeling of their sorrow, but they are not tears of weak sentiment, but of a noble pathos that hastens to help with a divine sufficiency.

Such a supreme act of rebellion could not fail to draw down unexampled judgment.</p><p>In <ref><reflink target=\"Joh 12:48\">Joh 12:48</reflink>-50</ref> our Lord unfolds to us the significance of His words. They will be the sole criterion at the day of judgment. He will apply to each of us the rule laid down in His teachings, which were purely and simply the reflection of His Father&#146;s mind. In every sentence He acted on the Father&#146;s mandate; hence His words were capable of quickening and regenerating His hearers. What a marvelous effect would be produced on the world if all ministers of Christ would utter what they had received!</p><p><i>For Review Questions, see the e-Sword Book Comments.</i></p>"

It was expedient for the disciples that the Lord should go, because the Spirit&#146;s presence was contingent upon His absence. The text needed to be completed before the great sermon could be preached. Christ&#146;s work must be finished before the Spirit could apply it. Every phase of human experience centers in Him whom the Holy Spirit reveals. Whether it be conviction of sin, or faith, or hope, all begin and end with Jesus. The chief sin of the present age is its rejection of Christ, and it is for this that men are condemned. The assertions of Jesus as to Himself are vindicated, and His righteousness is established. His divine mission was proved by His resurrection and ascension. The Cross was the scene of Satan&#146;s judgment. There the prince of this world was condemned and cast out. His power is broken, though he still does his utmost to intimidate and hinder the followers of Jesus.</p><p>The world comes to us first with her fascinations and delights. She comes next with her frowns and tortures. Behind her is her prince. He, however, exists only by sufferance. Meet him as a discredited foe. He has been judged and condemned.

Sorrow had filled their heart, and the Master forbore to describe in further detail the valley of shadow through which they were still to pass. A comparison of the Gospels and Epistles will indicate how much our Lord left unsaid. All this remained for the Spirit&#146;s teaching, to be communicated to the Church through the Apostles. It is thus that Christ deals with us still, apportioning our trials to our strength, our discipline to our spiritual capacity. We long to know God&#146;s secret plans for ourselves, and for those whom we love. Where does the path lead which we are treading, and which dips so swiftly and abruptly? How much longer will the fight be maintained between Truth on the scaffold and Wrong on the throne? What is the explanation of the mystery of evil, of the sorrow and agony of the world?

He suggested, therefore, that the Jewish leaders should deal with it under their own statutes. There was no apparent need for Roman law to interfere.

It was clear, therefore, that the Corinthian Christians could not consistently partake of idol feasts and the Lord&#146;s Supper.

It was a common practice, and meant nothing so far as Christian disciples were concerned. But if an unbeliever were to make the meal a test of faith, by reminding believers that in partaking of such food they were implicitly partners in heathen rites, then there was no course but to refuse and abstain.</p><p>In every meal and act we must so conduct ourselves that praise and honor may redound to God. The thankful enjoyment of God&#146;s gifts of food, which constitutes the essence of a Christian meal, must always be subordinated to our consideration of the religious scruples of others; and we must avoid doing anything which would blunt and injure their faith.

But in each case the headship is not one of authority and rule, but of the impartation of resources of love, wisdom, and strength, without which the best cannot be realized. The covered head of woman in our sanctuaries as contrasted with the uncovered head of man is a sign and symbol of this interdependence.</p><p>But it is very interesting to notice that while the Gospel so clearly insists on the divine order, it has elevated woman to be man&#146;s true helpmeet, and has caused her to be honored and loved as the glory of man.

In Paul&#146;s thought of the matter, therefore, it was unseemly for the Christian matron to lay this aside. He conceded the absolute freedom and equality of male and female in Christ, and yet he stood for the observance of the best customs of the age, lest the gospel should be brought into disrepute. The women, therefore, must veil their heads in the Christian assemblies as the angels veil their faces in the presence of God.</p><p>The uncovered face of man is to the glory of God, but the covered face of woman recognizes that she finds her glory in her husband&#146;s love and care. Each is dependent on the other-the man on God, and the wife on her spouse.

This caused much heart-burning and was unworthy of Christians.</p><p>Note that the Apostle received the words of institution by direct revelation. The Lord&#146;s Supper is intended not only to commemorate the supreme act of Calvary, but to enable us spiritually to incorporate into ourselves the very life and death of Jesus, so that we may truly be crucified with Him and nevertheless live. &#147;That I may know Him and the fellowship of His sufferings.&#148; We are liable to condemnation if we do not recognize the Body of Christ-that is, the Church-the unity of which is disturbed and obscured when there is dissension.

He must direct and use us. We have nothing to do with the work He confides to others, and must concentrate on that which He wants to achieve through us. If this means co-operation with other members or service to them; if it means hidden obscurity or temporary disuse, we must be equally content. It is for Him to do as He will.

It is a great co-operative society, in which each is for all and all for each, and the object is to bring Christ into every department of our being and our fellowship, as the life-blood nourishes the body of man.

There was a strong tendency at Corinth to magnify the use of tongues; that is, forms of utterance which the assembly could not understand. The Apostle rebukes this, and says that it is far better to be able to speak to the edification of the hearers. Indeed, he directs that speech in an unknown tongue should be withheld, unless someone were present who could explain and interpret it.</p><p>The gift of tongues was a special sign intended for the convincing of that age, but it was not a necessary accompaniment of the filling of the Holy Spirit, and is certainly of inferior value. A mere blare of a trumpet, without note or modulation, conveys no meaning to the waiting ranks of soldiers; and the mere sound of an unknown tongue startles without teaching. Do not be content merely to make a sound; <i>say something.</i> Seek to do actual service to others is one of the three directions suggested in <ref><reflink target=\"1Co 14:3\">1Co 14:3</reflink></ref>. Edification is the building up of the soul in truth. Comfort is for the distressed and weary. Consolation is the heartening of the soul to fresh enterprise.</p>",
            "13": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>UNDERSTANDING PROMOTES EDIFYING </b></p><p>The Apostle here gives two practical directions, in order to restore the rule of the understanding above the babble of incoherent sounds, which was confusing the Corinthian church.</p><p>The <i>first</i> was that worship should be conducted in a form that the assembled congregation could understand. To utter prayer or thanksgiving to which the audience could give no assent; to utter sounds which were meaningless, was inconsistent with the true nature of Christian worship. It was therefore from this chapter that the Reformers drew their arguments against the practice of conducting the services of the Church in Latin. The <i>second</i> was that instruction was a most necessary part of worship, <ref><reflink target=\"1Co 14:19\">1Co 14:19</reflink></ref>.</p><p>The effect of prophesying, that is, preaching, is set forth very forcibly and beautifully in the closing verses of our reading. We must always have in mind the unbelieving and the unlearned. If he hears the solemn voice of God speaking through human lips to his conscience, stirring its depths, moving it to repentance and faith, he will bear speedy testimony to the truth of what he has heard. We must seek to have in our assemblies the convincing power of God&#146;s Word, accompanied by the corroborating witness of the unhindered Spirit.</p>",
            "26": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>ORDER OF CHURCH SERVICES </b></p><p>Again the Apostle sums up his directions in two simple rules: 1. <i>Let all things be done unto edifying;</i> that is, to building up individual character, and to fitting each member as a brick or stone into the rising fabric of the Church. Hence the stress laid on prophesying or speaking under the impulse of God&#146;s Spirit. All who had that gift should certainly have a chance to use it, because the whole Church would be thereby profited and enriched. 2. <i>Let all things be done decently and in order: decently,</i> so as not to interrupt the dignity and gravity of the services; <i>in order,</i> not by hazard or impulse, but by design and arrangement.</p><p>The Apostle&#146;s ideal is that of the calm and simple majesty which should mark all solemn assemblies, as distinct from fanatical and frenzied excitement. Hence he discountenances the disuse of the Eastern veil (the badge of modesty), the speaking of women in public, and the interruption of speakers by each other. That the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets is a truth of universal application. It condemns every impulse of a religious character which is not under the intelligent control of those who display it.</p>"

It is the most memorable argument in existence for the resurrection of the body. We need hardly stay to distinguish between this and the immortality of the soul. The former is distinctly a Christian teaching; the latter has been held by vast numbers outside of the Christian pale.</p><p>Notice that the Resurrection was primarily not a doctrine but a <i>fact.</i> It is not necessary to argue it, but simply to <i>say</i> that Christ arose, therefore all will arise, because Christ is the Son of man. Other religions rest on foundations of philosophy and metaphysics, but the empty grave in Joseph&#146;s garden is the keystone of the arch. If that cannot be maintained, as it was in the primitive Church, the whole superstructure crumbles like a mass of clouds. But it <i>can be</i> maintained. There is even more evidence for it than for any fact of modern history. Men may as soon refuse to believe in the battle of Waterloo as in our Lord&#146;s resurrection. The testimony of Paul is most important, because he knew all that could be alleged or argued against it by the Pharisees. Indeed, he had himself opposed it.

There must be such a thing, because he, as the representative of humanity, arose from the dead, in a human body which, though more ethereal in its texture, was easily recognizable by those who had known Him previously. Mary was recalled by the well-known intonations of her Master&#146;s voice. Thomas was compelled to believe, in spite of his protestations to the contrary. In fact, all of our Lord&#146;s friends were convinced against themselves. They credited the tidings of the risen Lord as idle tales. Therefore, says the Apostle, it is far easier to admit that man will rise than to face the difficulties of a still buried Christ, a vain faith, a vain gospel, and a false testimony from so many accredited witnesses.</p><p>What a burst of music breaks forth in <ref><reflink target=\"1Co 15:20\">1Co 15:20</reflink>-28</ref>! The first fruit sheaf is the forerunner and specimen of all the harvest. In Christ the whole Church was presented to God, and we may judge of the whole by Him.

            "29": "<p align=center style='text-align:center;'><b>THIS BODY THE SEED OF A GLORIOUS ONE </b></p><p>The anticipation of the final resurrection enabled the early Christians to endure incredible sufferings. As one rank fell martyred, another was ready to step into its place; and the <i>catechumens,</i> or young believers, took the names of the martyrs, so as to perpetuate their testimony. With this hope in his heart Paul himself had confronted at Ephesus the tumult of the infuriated mob, <ref><reflink target=\"Act 19:1\">Act 19:1</reflink>-41</ref>. Belief in this sublime undoing of the last effects of sin was one of the chief features in the conquering power of Christianity.</p><p>In every seed there is the germ of a new and beautiful growth, more elaborate and yet identical; so in each of us there is something which has the capacity and potentiality of furnishing another body, through which the emancipated spirit will be able to express itself more perfectly than it can in this body, which is composed of coarser materials. It is not difficult to believe in this, when we have seen the caterpillar become the butterfly. The world is full of wonderful and beautiful things. God&#146;s inventiveness reveals itself in a myriad differing organisms. It is by His will that the golden head of wheat is fairer than the little brown seed cast into the furrow; so it is His pleasure that the body which is to be shall surpass the present in glory.</p>",

It will be a spiritual body, able to go and come at a wish or a thought; a body that will be perfectly adapted to its spiritual world environment. The last Adam, our Lord, will effect this for us. But we must in the meanwhile be content to make the best use of the discipline of mortality, keeping our body pure and sweet as the temple and vehicle of the Holy Spirit until we are born into the next stage of existence. Always the physical before the psychical and the psychical before the spiritual.</p><p>What triumph rings through those last four verses! As generations of Christians have stood around the mortal remains of their beloved, they have uttered these words of immortal hope.

The thoughts to which he has given expression should surely lead to some tangible response of Christian duty and activity, or they would injure rather than help. Nothing is more injurious to the Christian conscience than trumpet-sounding which leads to no response in action. If the foregoing chapter does not stimulate Christian generosity, nothing will.</p><p>Note <i>the time</i>-the first day of the week, indicating the reverence with which the early Christians regarded that day. <i>The method</i>-the definite appropriation for God&#146;s work of a certain proportion of income, as it accrues. <i>The proportion</i>-as the giver may be prospered. Paul disliked vehement collection appeals, and advised that we should give according to a system, and not merely by impulse.</p><p>Remember it is God who opens great and effectual doors before His servants.

Because Timothy was deficient in virile strength, Paul was always contriving to make his way easier; and though Apollos had drawn away some of his converts, the Apostle was desirous for him to visit Corinth again. Nor could he forget the household which had yielded him the first fruits. His solitude had been greatly cheered by the advent of the Corinthian deputation. Human love is a revelation of the divine; an earthen pitcher which God fills with heavenly treasure; a chalice holding the wine of life.</p><p>Notice the flaming forth of Paul&#146;s passionate love for Christ.

We can do a great deal with those whom we desire to correct or instruct, if we begin by commending all that is worthy of being praised. Thus the Apostle rejoices in the evidences of the trinity of Christian graces-Faith, Hope, and Love. His prayer-book was filled with intercession. One marvels at the accomplishment of this extraordinary man, who, in addition to his travels, labors, writings, and toil for his daily bread, had time for such abundant prayerfulness.</p><p>There is a note of triumph in his reference to the reception given to the gospel in all the world. The handful of corn on the top of the mountains was already beginning to shake like Lebanon. It seemed as though victory was assured; and if only the Church had possessed more men like him, the world would have been saved some sad experiences.

We all need a quicker insight into God&#146;s will, and this is only acquired through the wisdom and understanding communicated by the Holy Spirit to our spirits. But that understanding is conditioned, as in <ref><reflink target=\"Col 1:10\">Col 1:10</reflink></ref>, by a daily behavior which pleases God and bears fruit in every good work. It is as we slowly climb the ascent of consistent living that the landscape of God&#146;s nature expands around us. As character and knowledge grow, so will our spiritual strength; but notice that frequently such strength is needed not so much for great exploits, as for the patient bearing of the Cross, <ref><reflink target=\"Col 1:11\">Col 1:11</reflink></ref>.</p><p>In view of the fact that we are being qualified for an inheritance in light, there should be a song of perennial thanksgiving proceeding from us.

And He will never abandon His work until we arrive in His presence-chamber without spot or blemish or any such thing. But, of course, the putting forth of His power on our behalf is conditioned on our steadfast faith.</p><p>Paul drank deeply of the Master&#146;s cup. It seemed as if Jesus had trusted him with participation in the sorrows of Gethsemane and Calvary. And he was thus fitted for the stewardship of two great secrets, which it was his joy to unfold. In <ref><reflink target=\"Eph 3:1\">Eph 3:1</reflink>-21</ref> he says that he was commissioned to show the Gentiles that they might become fellow-heirs; but here, <ref><reflink target=\"Col 1:27\">Col 1:27</reflink></ref>, that they might experience the indwelling of Christ. Those who are conscious of that indwelling know its riches of power and joy and victory. Their hope of glory is dimmed by no fear, because they have the Christ; in their hearts, and, therefore, heaven in their hearts, so it follows naturally that their hearts will one day be with Christ in heaven. Christ in us is the hope of glory. Note the individual interest which the true pastor takes in his flock, as shown in the repeated use of <i>every man</i>.</p>"

We belong to the world on the threshold of which Jesus said, &#147;Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended.&#148; We must guard against the defiling touch of the world, of sin, and of the old self-life. We stand between two worlds, each solicits us: let us yield to the influences that pull us upward, and not to those that anchor us to this sinful and vain world.

We must not always live in the negative of avoiding wrong, the positive has a clear claim on us; and in each circumstance of trial or temptation we must advance to meet it, arrayed in Christ. As the Lord acted, so must we. We must partake of the family likeness. When a Christian friend manifests over the breakfast-table some ugly feature of the old life, we may fairly urge him to return to his room and complete his dressing. Love is the girdle of the Christian attire.</p><p>Let the peace of Christ rule within. Let the word of Christ dwell in the innermost chambers of the soul. Let there be mutual love and wholesome glee, the song in the life, and the grace in the heart. Whatever is wrong will shiver to pieces like a glass when the name of Jesus is spoken over it.

No act of life can be left outside the sacred enclosure of His everlasting love. As the moon affects the tides around the world, even in the smallest indentations of the coast, so must the power of Christ&#146;s resurrection make itself felt in the behavior of the servant and the child.</p><p>It is especially beautiful to notice the Apostle&#146;s constant reference to the bond-slaves who formed so important an element in the early Church. There they learned that in Christ all souls were free, and that in Him also master and slave were brethren. Stealing out at night from the arduous labors of his lot, many a poor slave would return with new conceptions of his daily tasks, to be applied to the service rendered to his Lord. No angel in heaven&#146;s high temple has more definite service to the King than any honest and industrious servant may daily render to Jesus. Here is the dignity of labor indeed!

He clung to them the more tenaciously because he had been cast out by his Jewish brethren, and also because he looked for a great revenue of joy and glory to accrue to the Savior&#146;s name.

Timothy was a lad of fifteen when converted at Lystra, and was probably about thirty-five years of age when this Epistle was addressed to him.

Their teaching led from spiritual pride to sensuality, for they accounted the body as inherently evil. All this was contrary to <i>healthy</i> doctrine.

He felt that he had been the chief of sinners, because he had sinned against more knowledge and opportunity than others. It is only when we see God, that we know ourselves and repent in dust and ashes. The Apostle, however, comforted himself in this at least, that through coming time the most hopeless and abandoned sinners would take heart as they considered his case. He was a sample of mercy, a specimen of what Christ could do, an outline sketch to be filled in. Believe <i>on</i> Christ. Faith rests on Christ as foundation. Peter and John use another preposition, <i>toward</i>, or <i>into, i.e</i>., they conceive of union with him, to which all else is preliminary. War the good warfare, that against sin.

It is our duty to pray for those in authority, and to seek after a calm and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. It was most important that Christians should not be suspected of revolutionary designs or civic turbulence. If they had to suffer, it must be only on account of their religious faith. The solidarity of our race is the reason for our wide-embracing supplications. The whole race is one in the creation of God and the ransom of Christ; we are therefore one with all men, and should express in prayer the common sins and sorrows of mankind.</p><p>The <i>men</i> were bidden to lead in public prayer, and to see that the hands they uplifted were clean, while the <i>women</i> joined quietly after the Eastern fashion.

The tone of a Christian community is largely that of its leaders. As the margin suggests, the bishop of the early Church was an overseer or presbyter. See <ref><reflink target=\"Act 20:28\">Act 20:28</reflink></ref>, R.V. God&#146;s minister must not only be irreproachable as far as the outside world is concerned, but exemplary in his domestic relations. Such was the facility of divorce among the Jews that it was a common thing for a man to have more than one woman living who had been his wife: but by Paul&#146;s ruling this would debar him from holding office, unless his divorce be for cause as provided in <ref><reflink target=\"Mat 19:9\">Mat 19:9</reflink></ref>.</p><p>Notice how often those words <i>grave, sober-minded, temperate</i> occur in this chapter. The effect of a good sermon will be spoiled if a man yields to foolish levity or intemperate habits. Moderation, serenity of temper, freedom from love of money, a well-ordered household, an obedient and reverent family-these are signs that a man may aspire to the sacred work of the ministry; and these are the qualities which people should look for in candidates for pulpits, more than those of rhetoric, brilliance, or outward attractiveness.</p>",

Though their service was less important, their character must be of the highest quality. The strength of a church is as much in the godliness of those who fill subordinate offices, as in its acknowledged leaders. The caretaker of a church should be a man of as high ideals as its chief pastor. Nothing is common or unclean, nothing trivial and unimportant, where Christ&#146;s honor and glory are concerned.

Notwithstanding all that Christ has done, the prevalence of evil will be enormous, not because of any failure in God but because the Church has failed to be the organ through which His saving help could reach mankind. The symptoms are set forth with great clearness, such as demon spirits dwelling and working in men, error taught under the specious guise of excessive religious devotion, consciences seared, natural instincts thwarted and outraged. On the contrary, let us believe that the whole body, and all gifts that are natural and innocent, are to be cherished and used under three sanctions:</p><p class=\"indent1\">1.

Nothing counts apart from God. Prayer implies that all our gifts and efforts cover only a small part of our efficiency. There are infinite resources in God, which He is waiting to employ in human affairs, and of which we fail to make use. The Christian worker, therefore, must not only labor and strive, but must hope in the living God, whose saving grace is at the disposal of our faith. The faith exercised by the average man results in obtaining only natural things; the supernatural is secured by the faith of those who have made profounder discoveries of God, and can therefore make demands on His resources, which are hidden from the princes of this world.</p><p>In order to succeed, we must give ourselves wholly to our work for God. In answer to prayer great gifts had been communicated to Timothy, but he had to give heed to them, use them, and stir up the slumbering embers of the fire, kindled at his ordination.

Remember that all intercourse with others must be governed by the words-<i>in all purity</i>.</p><p>The special references to widows evidence the early practice of the Church. Provision was made for godly women who had lost husbands by death, and who in return for the weekly gift from church funds, gave themselves to Christian service. The Apostle indicates the age and characteristics of those who might be eligible. It was his clear judgment, however, that, wherever possible, it was becoming for children to make such provision as would place an aged mother or other relative beyond the reach of want or any need of claiming maintenance from church funds. Our nurses and deaconesses are the modern counterparts of the order of widows in the early Church; yet the standard of Christian living here emphasized may well be pondered and prayed over by all Christian women, who should, as far as possible without fee or reward, consider church service only second to the claims of home.</p>",

These offices lovingly and humbly performed, will serve as a gracious opening for further ministries of the same description in the later period of life.</p><p>The Apostle says nothing about remarriage in general, but simply refers to the fact that young women who have become widows are likely to accept the offer of a second marriage, and so abjure that first faith, in which they had pledged themselves to the service of the church. Unless there is great watchfulness, the practice of going from house to house, ostensibly on church business, may degenerate into gossip-mongering. Therefore it was wiser not to put young women on the church service roll. If they did not marry a second time, they might at least work for the maintenance of others, widows like themselves, but less able to help themselves. There must be no idling.</p>",

Purity, gravity, and abstinence from alcohol were prime requisites in a Christian minister then, as they are now. It is clear from <ref><reflink target=\"1Ti 5:23\">1Ti 5:23</reflink></ref> that the Apostles and their helpers practiced total abstinence, or there had been no need for that special injunction to Timothy.</p><p>It is clear also from <ref><reflink target=\"1Ti 5:17\">1Ti 5:17</reflink>-18</ref> that the early Church was encouraged to support its ministers.

The character of a minister might not be lightly aspersed.

But public wrongs must be met by public rebuke that any suspicion of favoritism might be disarmed. No man, however, should be called to the sacred and responsible position of presbyter, unless he had been tested and approved.

If the slave was in the household of a heathen master, he must honor and glorify Christ by being respectful and obedient; but if the master was a Christian, and therefore a brother in the Lord, he was still required to yield courteous and willing service. Service rendered for the love of God must not be inferior to that rendered from fear of man.</p><p>There were many false teachers in the early Church, the chief aim of whom was to make money. They were proud and distempered, jealous and suspicious, juggling with words and given to splitting hairs. Godliness truly is great gain. It makes us content with what we have, and it opens to us stores of blessedness which the wealth of a Croesus could not buy. It is good to have just what is necessary. More than that breeds anxiety. Let us leave the provision for our needs with God. He is pledged to give food and covering, the latter including shelter.

The true wealth of life is in self-renunciation and beneficence. How different from the money-grabber is the man of God who flees such things, and follows after righteousness, who fights the good fight against the world, the flesh, and the devil, and who never flinches from witnessing the good witness. If we suffer here with Jesus, we shall share in the glory of His manifestation. Notice the wealth of the Apostle&#146;s ascription to Jesus!

The devil has always set himself to counterfeit God&#146;s handiwork: the Holy City by Babylon; the Son of man by the man of sin; blessedness by the worldling&#146;s giddy merriment. Thus the Egyptian conjurers repeated the miracles of Moses by resorting to sleight of hand. So there is a pure gospel and a specious mimicry of it.

But, whatever the losses and trials, let the children of God abide in the things which they have learned, and walk in blameless purity and consistency. The conduct, purpose, and patience of this great and holy Apostle gleam in front of us for our inspiration and guidance; and his experience will be ours-that there is no sorrow out of which we shall not be delivered, when we have learned the lesson it was sent to teach.</p><p>In the stern experiences of human life there is no stay that is comparable to the Holy Scriptures. The infinite variety of Scripture adapts itself to different states of the soul. Whatever our need, we can find its solace and remedy here.

When we are aware of the reality of these things, we naturally take them into account when we act.

The mischief with men generally is that they do not know themselves, and do not want to know; and they are equally ignorant of the rich stores of blessedness that Christ waits to bestow.

He alone knows the contents; He alone presides over their development. We must not weep because the future is unknown. &#147;Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.&#148; We must trust our own future to Christ without fear or tears of foreboding. The Lamb who shed His blood to redeem may be trusted to order and perfect that which concerneth us.</p><p>What contrasts presented themselves! The Apostle looked for a lion, and behold, a lamb; for one who had overcome, and instead, one who had the appearance of having been slain; for one who had the majesty of a king, and instead, the emblem of humility.

If we are priests and kings in His ideal, we may trust Him so to arrange our life-plan as to secure the best exercise of those sacred functions.</p><p>Notice how the out-circling song of the redeemed reaches out in further and yet further response. It begins with the little group around the throne; then it spreads to the angels in their myriads; and thence it is borne forward and outward in concentric rings until the utmost shores of space are struck by the billows of song and it reverberates back to the living creatures and the elders. Heaven is full of the sacrificial side of our Savior&#146;s death.
