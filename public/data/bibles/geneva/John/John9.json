{"1":"And as Iesus passed by, he sawe a man which was blinde from his birth.","2":"And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sinne, this man, or his parents, that he was borne blinde?","3":"Iesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the workes of God should be shewed on him.","4":"I must worke the workes of him that sent me, while it is day: the night commeth when no man can worke.","5":"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.","6":"Assoone as he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spettle, and anointed the eyes of the blinde with the clay,","7":"And sayd vnto him, Go wash in the poole of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came againe seeing.","8":"Nowe the neighbours and they that had seene him before, when he was blinde, sayd, Is not this he that sate and begged?","9":"Some said, This is he: and other sayd, He is like him: but he himselfe sayd, I am he.","10":"Therefore they sayd vnto him, Howe were thine eyes opened?","11":"He answered, and sayd, The man that is called Iesus, made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and sayde vnto me, Goe to the poole of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and receiued sight.","12":"Then they sayd vnto him, Where is he? He sayd, I can not tell.","13":"They brought to the Pharises him that was once blinde.","14":"And it was the Sabbath day, when Iesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.","15":"Then againe the Pharises also asked him, how he had receiued sight; hee sayd vnto them, He layd clay vpon mine eyes, & I washed, and doe see.","16":"Then said some of the Pharises, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sabbath day. Others sayd, Howe can a man that is a sinner, doe such miracles? and there was a dissension among them.","17":"Then spake they vnto the blinde againe, What sayest thou of him, because he hath opened thine eyes? And he sayd, He is a Prophet.","18":"Then the Iewes did not beleeue him (that he had bene blinde, and receiued his sight) vntill they had called the parents of him that had receiued sight.","19":"And they asked them, saying, Is this your sonne, whom ye say was borne blinde? How doeth he nowe see then?","20":"His parents answered them, and sayd, We know that this is our sonne, & that he was borne blinde:","21":"But by what meanes hee nowe seeth, we know not: or who hath opened his eyes, can we not tell: he is olde ynough: aske him: hee shall answere for himselfe.","22":"These wordes spake his parents, because they feared the Iewes: for the Iewes had ordeined already, that if any man did confesse that he was Christ, he should be excommunicate out of the Synagogue.","23":"Therefore sayde his parents, Hee is olde ynough: aske him.","24":"Then againe called they the man that had bene blinde, and sayd vnto him, Giue glory vnto God: we know that this man is a sinner.","25":"Then he answered, and sayd, Whether hee be a sinner or no, I can not tell: one thing I know, that I was blinde, and nowe I see.","26":"Then sayd they to him againe, What did he to thee? howe opened he thine eyes?","27":"Hee answered them, I haue tolde you already, and yee haue not heard it: wherefore would yee heare it againe? will yee also be his disciples?","28":"Then reuiled they him, and sayd, Be thou his disciple: we be Moses disciples.","29":"We know that God spake with Moses: but this man we know not from whence he is.","30":"The man answered, and sayde vnto them, Doutlesse, this is a marueilous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.","31":"Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him heareth he.","32":"Since the world began, was it not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blinde.","33":"If this man were not of God, hee could haue done nothing.","34":"They answered, and sayd vnto him, Thou art altogether borne in sinnes, and doest thou teach vs? so they cast him out.","35":"Iesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he sayd vnto him, Doest thou beleeue in the Sonne of God?","36":"He answered, and sayd, Who is he, Lord, that I might beleeue in him?","37":"And Iesus sayd vnto him, Both thou hast seene him, and he it is that talketh with thee.","38":"Then he sayd, Lord, I beleeue, and worshipped him.","39":"And Iesus sayd, I am come vnto iudgement into this world, that they which see not, might see: and that they which see, might be made blinde.","40":"And some of the Pharises which were with him, heard these things, & sayd vnto him, Are we blinde also?","41":"Iesus sayd vnto them, If ye were blinde, ye should not haue sinne: but nowe ye say, We see: therefore your sinne remaineth."}
