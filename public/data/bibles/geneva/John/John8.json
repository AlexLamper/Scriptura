{"1":"And Iesus went vnto the mount of Oliues,","2":"And early in the morning came againe into the Temple, and all the people came vnto him, and he sate downe, and taught them.","3":"Then the Scribes, & the Pharises brought vnto him a woman, taken in adulterie, and set her in the middes,","4":"And said vnto him, Master, we foud this woman committing adulterie, euen in the very acte.","5":"Now Moses in our Law commanded, that such should be stoned: what sayest thou therefore?","6":"And this they saide to tempt him, that they might haue, whereof to accuse him. But Iesus stouped downe, & with his finger wrote on the groud.","7":"And while they continued asking him, hee lift himselfe vp, and sayde vnto them, Let him that is among you without sinne, cast the first stone at her.","8":"And againe hee stouped downe, and wrote on the ground.","9":"And when they heard it, being accused by their owne conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at ye eldest euen to the last: so Iesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the mids.","10":"When Iesus had lift vp himselfe againe, and sawe no man, but the woman, hee saide vnto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?","11":"She said, No man, Lord; Iesus said, Neither do I condemne thee: go and sinne no more.","12":"Then spake Iesus againe vnto them, saying, I am that light of the worlde: hee that followeth mee, shall not walke in darkenes, but shall haue that light of life.","13":"The Pharises therefore saide vnto him, Thou bearest recorde of thy selfe: thy recorde is not true.","14":"Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them, Though I beare recorde of my selfe, yet my recorde is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I goe.","15":"Ye iudge after the flesh: I iudge no man.","16":"And if I also iudge, my iudgement is true: for I am not alone, but I, and the Father, that sent mee.","17":"And it is also written in your Lawe, that the testimonie of two men is true.","18":"I am one that beare witnes of my selfe, and the Father that sent me, beareth witnes of me.","19":"Then saide they vnto him, Where is that Father of thine? Iesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor that Father of mine. If ye had knowen me, ye should haue knowen that Father of mine also.","20":"These wordes spake Iesus in the treasurie, as hee taught in the Temple, and no man layde handes on him: for his houre was not yet come.","21":"Then saide Iesus againe vnto them, I goe my way, and ye shal seeke me, and shal die in your sinnes, Whither I goe, can ye not come.","22":"Then said the Iewes, Will he kill himselfe, because he saith, Whither I goe, can ye not come?","23":"And hee saide vnto them, Ye are from beneath, I am from aboue: ye are of this world, I am not of this worlde.","24":"I said therefore vnto you, That ye shall die in your sinnes: for except ye beleeue, that I am he, ye shall die in your sinnes.","25":"Then saide they vnto him, Who art thou? And Iesus saide vnto them, Euen the same thing that I said vnto you from the beginning.","26":"I haue many things to say, & to iudge of you: but he that sent me, is true, & the things that I haue heard of him, those speake I to the world.","27":"They vnderstoode not that hee spake to them of the Father.","28":"Then said Iesus vnto them, When ye haue lift vp the Sonne of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I doe nothing of my selfe, but as my Father hath taught me, so I speake these things.","29":"For he that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left me alone, because I do alwayes those things that please him.","30":"As hee spake these thinges, many beleeued in him.","31":"Then saide Iesus to the Iewes which beleeued in him, If ye continue in my worde, ye are verely my disciples,","32":"And shall know the trueth, and the trueth shall make you free.","33":"They answered him, Wee be Abrahams seede, and were neuer bonde to any man: why sayest thou then, Ye shalbe made free?","34":"Iesus answered them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, that whosoeuer committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne.","35":"And the seruant abideth not in the house for euer: but the Sonne abideth for euer.","36":"If that Sonne therefore shal make you free, ye shalbe free in deede.","37":"I know that ye are Abrahams seede, but yee seeke to kill mee, because my worde hath no place in you.","38":"I speake that which I haue seene with my Father: and ye doe that which ye haue seene with your father.","39":"They answered, and saide vnto him, Abraham is our father. Iesus said vnto them, If ye were Abrahams children, ye woulde doe the workes of Abraham.","40":"But nowe ye goe about to kill mee, a man that haue told you the trueth, which I haue heard of God: this did not Abraham.","41":"Ye do the workes of your father. Then said they to him, We are not borne of fornication: we haue one Father, which is God.","42":"Therefore Iesus sayde vnto them, If God were your Father, then woulde ye loue mee: for I proceeded foorth, and came from God, neither came I of my selfe, but he sent me.","43":"Why doe ye not vnderstande my talke? because ye cannot heare my worde.","44":"Ye are of your father the deuill, and the lustes of your father ye will doe: hee hath bene a murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the trueth, because there is no trueth in him. When hee speaketh a lie, then speaketh hee of his owne: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.","45":"And because I tell you the trueth, yee beleeue me not.","46":"Which of you can rebuke me of sinne? and if I say the trueth, why do ye not beleeue me?","47":"He that is of God, heareth Gods wordes: yee therefore heare them not, because ye are not of God.","48":"Then answered the Iewes, and said vnto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritane, and hast a deuil?","49":"Iesus answered, I haue not a deuil, but I honour my Father, and ye haue dishonoured me.","50":"And I seeke not mine owne praise: but there is one that seeketh it, and iudgeth.","51":"Verely, verely I say vnto you, If a man keepe my word, he shall neuer see death.","52":"Then said the Iewes to him, Now know we that thou hast a deuill. Abraham is dead, and the Prophets: and thou sayest, If a man keepe my worde, he shall neuer taste of death.","53":"Art thou greater then our father Abraham, which is dead? and the Prophets are dead: whome makest thou thy selfe?","54":"Iesus answered, If I honour my selfe, mine honour is nothing worth: it is my Father that honoureth me, whome ye say, that hee is your God.","55":"Yet ye haue not knowen him: but I knowe him, and if I should say I know him not, I should be a liar like vnto you: but I knowe him, and keepe his worde.","56":"Your father Abraham reioyced to see my day, and he sawe it, and was glad.","57":"Then sayd ye Iewes vnto him, Thou art not yet fiftie yeere olde, & hast thou seene Abraham?","58":"Iesus sayd vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, before Abraham was, I am.","59":"Then tooke they vp stones, to cast at him, but Iesus hid himselfe, and went out of the Temple: And hee passed through the middes of them, and so went his way."}
