{"1":"I Am that true vine, and my Father is that husband man.","2":"Euery branch that beareth not fruite in me, he taketh away: and euery one that beareth fruite, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruite.","3":"Nowe are ye cleane through the worde, which I haue spoken vnto you.","4":"Abide in me, and I in you: as the branche cannot beare fruite of it selfe, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.","5":"I am that vine: ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, & I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruite: for without me can ye doe nothing.","6":"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branche, and withereth: and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they burne.","7":"If ye abide in me, and my wordes abide in you, aske what ye wil, & it shalbe done to you.","8":"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye beare much fruite, and be made my disciples.","9":"As the father hath loued me, so haue I loued you: continue in that my loue.","10":"If ye shall keepe my commandements, ye shall abide in my loue, as I haue kept my Fathers commandements, and abide in his loue.","11":"These things haue I spoken vnto you, that my ioy might remaine in you, and that your ioy might be full.","12":"This is my commandement, that ye loue one another, as I haue loued you.","13":"Greater loue then this hath no man, when any man bestoweth his life for his friendes.","14":"Ye are my friendes, if ye doe whatsoeuer I commaund you.","15":"Henceforth call I you not seruants: for the seruant knoweth not what his master doeth: but I haue called you friends: for all things that I haue heard of my Father, haue I made knowen to you.","16":"Ye haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you, and ordeined you, that ye goe & bring foorth fruite, and that your fruite remaine, that whatsoeuer ye shall aske of the Father in my Name, he may giue it you.","17":"These things commaunde I you, that ye loue one another.","18":"If the worlde hate you, ye knowe that it hated me before you.","19":"If ye were of the worlde, the world woulde loue his owne: but because ye are not of ye world, but I haue chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.","20":"Remember the word that I said vnto you, The seruant is not greater then his master. If they haue persecuted me, they will persecute you also: if they haue kept my worde, they will also keepe yours.","21":"But all these things will they doe vnto you for my Names sake, because they haue not knowen him that sent me.","22":"If I had not come and spoken vnto them, they shoulde not haue had sinne: but nowe haue they no cloke for their sinne.","23":"He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.","24":"If I had not done workes among them which none other man did, they had not had sinne: but nowe haue they both seene, and haue hated both me, and my Father.","25":"But it is that the worde might be fulfilled, that is written in their Lawe, They hated me without a cause.","26":"But when that Comforter shall come, whom I will send vnto you from the Father, euen the Spirit of trueth, which proceedeth of the Father, he shall testifie of me.","27":"And ye shall witnesse also, because ye haue bene with me from the beginning."}
