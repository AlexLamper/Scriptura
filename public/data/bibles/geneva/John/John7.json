If thou doest these things, shewe thy selfe to the worlde.","5":"For as yet his brethren beleeued not in him.","6":"Then Iesus saide vnto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always readie.","7":"The world can not hate you: but me it hateth, because I testifie of it, that the workes thereof are euill.","8":"Go ye vp vnto this feast: I wil not go vp yet vnto this feast: for my time is not yet fulfilled.","9":"These things he sayde vnto them, and abode still in Galile.","10":"But assoone as his brethren were gone vp, then went hee also vp vnto the feast, not openly, but as it were priuilie.","11":"Then the Iewes sought him at the feast, and saide, Where is hee?","12":"And much murmuring was there of him among the people. Some said, He is a good man: other sayd, Nay: but he deceiueth the people.","13":"Howbeit no man spake openly of him for feare of the Iewes.","14":"Nowe when halfe the feast was done, Iesus went vp into the Temple and taught.","15":"And the Iewes marueiled, saving, Howe knoweth this man the Scriptures, seeing that hee neuer learned!","16":"Iesus answered them, and saide, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.","17":"If any man will doe his will, he shall knowe of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speake of my selfe.","18":"Hee that speaketh of himselfe, seeketh his owne glorie: but hee that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no vnrighteousnes is in him.","19":"Did not Moses giue you a Law, and yet none of you keepeth the lawe?
