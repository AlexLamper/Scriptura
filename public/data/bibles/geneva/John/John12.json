{"1":"Then Iesus, sixe dayes before the Passeouer, came to Bethania, where Lazarus was, who died, whom he had raised from the dead.","2":"There they made him a supper, and Martha serued: but Lazarus was one of them that sate at the table with him.","3":"Then tooke Mary a pound of oyntment of Spikenarde very costly, and anoynted Iesus feete, and wiped his feete with her heare, and the house was filled with the sauour of the oyntment.","4":"Then said one of his disciples, euen Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne, which should betray him:","5":"Why was not this oyntment sold for three hundreth pence, and giuen to the poore?","6":"Nowe he said this, not that he cared for the poore, but because hee was a theefe, and had the bagge, and bare that which was giuen.","7":"Then said Iesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying she kept it.","8":"For the poore alwayes yee haue with you, but me ye shall not haue alwayes.","9":"Then much people of the Iewes knewe that hee was there: and they came, not for Iesus sake onely, but that they might see Lazarus also, whome he had raysed from the dead.","10":"The hie Priestes therefore consulted, that they might put Lazarus to death also,","11":"Because that for his sake many of the Iewes went away, and beleeued in Iesus.","12":"On the morowe a great multitude that were come to the feast, when they heard that Iesus should come to Hierusalem,","13":"Tooke branches of palme trees, and went foorth to meete him, and cried, Hosanna, Blessed is the King of Israel that commeth in the Name of the Lorde.","14":"And Iesus found a yong asse, and sate thereon, as it is written,","15":"Feare not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King commeth sitting on an asses colte.","16":"But his disciples vnderstoode not these thinges at the first: but when Iesus was glorified, then remembred they, that these thinges were written of him, and that they had done these things vnto him.","17":"The people therefore that was with him, bare witnesse that hee called Lazarus out of the graue, and raised him from the dead.","18":"Therefore mette him the people also, because they heard that he had done this miracle.","19":"And the Pharises said among themselues, Perceiue ye howe ye preuaile nothing? Beholde, the worlde goeth after him.","20":"Nowe there were certaine Greekes among them that came vp to worship at the feast.","21":"And they came to Philippe, which was of Bethsaida in Galile, and desired him, saying, Syr, we would see that Iesus.","22":"Philippe came and tolde Andrewe: and againe Andrewe and Philippe tolde Iesus.","23":"And Iesus answered them, saying, The houre is come, that the Sonne of man must bee glorified.","24":"Verely, verely I say vnto you, Except the wheate corne fall into the grounde and die, it bideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth foorth much fruite.","25":"He that loueth his life, shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world, shall keepe it vnto life eternall.","26":"If any man serue me, let him followe me: for where I am, there shall also my seruant be: and if any man serue me, him will my Father honour.","27":"Now is my soule troubled: and what shall I say? Father, saue me from this houre: but therefore came I vnto this houre.","28":"Father, glorifie thy Name. Then came there a voyce from heauen, saying, I haue both glorified it, and will glorifie it againe.","29":"Then saide the people that stoode by, and heard, that it was a thunder: other said, An Angel spake to him.","30":"Iesus answered, and said, This voyce came not because of me, but for your sakes.","31":"Now is the iudgement of this world: nowe shall the prince of this world be cast out.","32":"And I, if I were lift vp from the earth, will drawe all men vnto me.","33":"Nowe this sayd he, signifying what death he should die.","34":"The people answered him, We haue heard out of the Law, that that Christ bideth for euer: and howe sayest thou, that that Sonne of man must be lift vp? Who is that Sonne of man?","35":"Then Iesus sayd vnto them, Yet a litle while is the light with you: walke while ye haue that light, lest the darkenes come vpon you: for hee that walketh in the darke, knoweth not whither he goeth.","36":"While ye haue that light, beleeue in that light, that ye may be the children of the light. These things spake Iesus, and departed, and hid himselfe from them.","37":"And though he had done so many miracles before them, yet beleeued they not on him,","38":"That the saying of Esaias the Prophete might be fulfilled, that he sayd, Lord, who beleeued our report? and to whome is the arme of the Lord reueiled?","39":"Therefore could they not beleeue, because that Esaias saith againe,","40":"He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their heart, that they shoulde not see with their eyes, nor vnderstand with their heart, and should be conuerted, and I should heale them.","41":"These things sayd Esaias when he sawe his glory, and spake of him.","42":"Neuertheles, euen among the chiefe rulers, many beleeued in him: but because of the Pharises they did not confesse him, least they should be cast out of the Synagogue.","43":"For they loued the prayse of men, more then the prayse of God.","44":"And Iesus cryed, and sayd, He that beleeueth in me, beleeueth not in me, but in him that sent me.","45":"And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.","46":"I am come a light into the world, that whosoeuer beleeueth in me, should not abide in darkenes.","47":"And if any man heare my wordes, and beleeue not, I iudge him not: for I came not to iudge the world, but to saue the world.","48":"He that refuseth me, and receiueth not my wordes, hath one that iudgeth him: the worde that I haue spoken, it shall iudge him in the last day.","49":"For I haue not spoken of my selfe: but the Father which sent me, hee gaue me a commaundement what I should say, and what I should speake.","50":"And I knowe that his commaundement is life euerlasting: the thinges therefore that I speake, I speake them so as the Father sayde vnto me."}
