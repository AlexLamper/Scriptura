{"1":"After that, there was a feast of the Iewes, and Iesus went vp to Hierusalem.","2":"And there is at Hierusalem by the place of the sheepe, a poole called in Ebrew Bethesda, hauing fiue porches:","3":"In the which lay a great multitude of sicke folke, of blinde, halte, and withered, wayting for the mouing of the water.","4":"For an Angel went downe at a certaine season into the poole, and troubled the water: whosoeuer then first, after the stirring of the water, stepped in, was made whole of whatsoeuer disease he had.","5":"And a certaine man was there, which had bene diseased eight and thirtie yeeres.","6":"When Iesus sawe him lie, and knew that he nowe long time had bene diseased, he saide vnto him, Wilt thou be made whole?","7":"The sicke man answered him, Sir, I haue no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the poole: but while I am coming, another steppeth downe before me.","8":"Iesus said vnto him, Rise: take vp thy bed, and walke.","9":"And immediately the man was made whole, and tooke vp his bed, and walked: and the same day was the Sabbath.","10":"The Iewes therefore said to him that was made whole, It is the Sabbath day: it is not lawfull for thee to cary thy bed.","11":"He answered them, He that made me whole, he said vnto me, Take vp thy bed, and walke.","12":"Then asked they him, What man is that which said vnto thee, Take vp thy bed and walke?","13":"And he that was healed, knewe not who it was: for Iesus had conueied himselfe away from the multitude that was in that place.","14":"And after that, Iesus founde him in the Temple, and said vnto him, Beholde, thou art made whole: sinne no more, lest a worse thing come vnto thee.","15":"The man departed and tolde the Iewes that it was Iesus, which had made him whole.","16":"And therefore the Iewes did persecute Iesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day.","17":"But Iesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I worke.","18":"Therefore the Iewes sought the more to kill him: not onely because he had broken the Sabbath: but said also that God was his Father, and made himselfe equall with God.","19":"Then answered Iesus, and said vnto them, Verely, verely I say vnto you, The Sonne can doe nothing of himselfe, saue that he seeth the Father doe: for whatsoeuer things he doth, the same things doeth the Sonne in like maner.","20":"For the Father loueth the Sonne, & sheweth him all things, whatsoeuer he himselfe doeth, and he will shewe him greater workes then these, that ye should marueile.","21":"For likewise as the Father rayseth vp the dead, and quickeneth them, so the Sonne quickeneth whom he will.","22":"For the Father iudgeth no man, but hath committed all iudgement vnto the Sonne,","23":"Because that all men shoulde honour the Sonne, as they honour the Father: he that honoureth not the Sonne, the same honoureth not the Father, which hath sent him.","24":"Verely, verely I say vnto you, he that heareth my worde, and beleeueth him that sent me, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but hath passed from death vnto life.","25":"Verely, verely I say vnto you, the houre shall come, and now is, when the dead shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God: and they that heare it, shall liue.","26":"For as the Father hath life in himselfe, so likewise hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himselfe,","27":"And hath giuen him power also to execute iudgement, in that he is the Sonne of man.","28":"Marueile not at this: for the houre shall come, in the which all that are in the graues, shall heare his voyce.","29":"And they shal come foorth, that haue done good, vnto ye resurrection of life: but they that haue done euil, vnto the resurrection of condemnation.","30":"I can doe nothing of mine owne selfe: as I heare, I iudge: and my iudgement is iust, because I seeke not mine owne will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me.","31":"If I should beare witnesse of my selfe, my witnesse were not true.","32":"There is another that beareth witnesse of me, and I know that the witnesse, which he beareth of me, is true.","33":"Ye sent vnto Iohn, and he bare witnesse vnto the trueth.","34":"But I receiue not the record of man: neuerthelesse these things I say, that ye might be saued.","35":"He was a burning, & a shining candle: and ye would for a season haue reioyced in his light.","36":"But I haue greater witnesse then the witnesse of Iohn: for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to finish, the same workes that I doe, beare witnesse of me, that the Father sent me.","37":"And the Father himselfe, which hath sent me, beareth witnesse of me. Ye haue not heard his voyce at any time, neither haue ye seene his shape.","38":"And his worde haue you not abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye beleeued not.","39":"Searche the Scriptures: for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they which testifie of me.","40":"But ye will not come to me, that ye might haue life.","41":"I receiue not the prayse of men.","42":"But I know you, that ye haue not the loue of God in you.","43":"I am come in my Fathers Name, and ye receiue me not: if another shall come in his owne name, him will ye receiue.","44":"How can ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of another, and seeke not the honour that commeth of God alone?","45":"Doe not thinke that I will accuse you to my Father: there is one that accuseth you, euen Moses, in whom ye trust.","46":"For had ye beleeued Moses, ye would haue beleeued me: for he wrote of me.","47":"But if ye beleeue not his writings, how shal ye beleeue my wordes?"}
