{"1":"Set the trumpet to thy mouth: he shall come as an egle against the House of the Lord, because they haue transgressed my couenant, & trespassed against my Lawe.","2":"Israel shall crie vnto me, My God, we know thee.","3":"Israel hath cast off ye thing that is good: the enemie shall pursue him.","4":"They haue set vp a King, but not by me: they haue made princes, and I knew it not: of their siluer and their gold haue they made them idoles: therefore shall they be destroyed.","5":"Thy calfe, O Samaria, hath cast thee off: mine anger is kindled against them: howe long will they be without innocencie!","6":"For it came euen from Israel: the workeman made it, therefore it is not God: but the calfe of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.","7":"For they haue sowne the winde, and they shall reape the whirlewind: it hath no stalke: the budde shall bring foorth no meale: if so be it bring forth, the strangers shall deuoure it.","8":"Israel is deuoured, now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessell wherein is no pleasure.","9":"For they are gone vp to Asshur: they are as a wilde asse alone by himselfe: Ephraim hath hired louers.","10":"Yet though they haue hired among the nations, nowe will I gather them, and they shall sorowe a litle, for the burden of the King and the princes.","11":"Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sinne, his altars shalbe to sinne.","12":"I haue written to them the great things of my Lawe: but they were counted as a strange thing.","13":"They sacrifice flesh for ye sacrifices of mine offerings, and eate it: but the Lorde accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquitie, and visite their sinnes: they shall returne to Egypt.","14":"For Israel hath forgotten his maker, and buildeth Temples, & Iudah hath increased strong cities: but I will sende a fire vpon his cities, and it shall deuoure the palaces thereof."}
