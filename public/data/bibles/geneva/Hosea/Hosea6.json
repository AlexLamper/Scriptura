{"1":"Come, and let vs returne to the Lord: for he hath spoyled, and he will heale vs: he hath wounded vs, and he will binde vs vp.","2":"After two dayes will he reuiue vs, and in the third day he will raise vs vp, and we shall liue in his sight.","3":"Then shall we haue knowledge, and indeuour our selues to know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning, and he shall come vnto vs as the raine, and as the latter raine vnto the earth.","4":"O Ephraim, what shall I doe vnto thee? O Iudah, how shall I intreate thee? for your goodnesse is as a morning cloude, and as the morning dewe it goeth away.","5":"Therefore haue I cut downe by the Prophets: I haue slaine them by the wordes of my mouth, and thy iudgements were as the light that goeth forth.","6":"For I desired mercie, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more then burnt offrings.","7":"But they like men haue transgressed the couenant: there haue they trespassed against me.","8":"Gilead is a citie of them that worke iniquitie, and is polluted with blood.","9":"And as the eues waite for a man, so the companie of Priestes murther in the way by consent: for they worke mischiefe.","10":"I haue seene vileny in the house of Israel: there is ye whoredome of Ephraim: Israel is defiled.","11":"Yea, Iudah hath set a plant for thee, whiles I woulde returne ye captiuitie of my people."}
