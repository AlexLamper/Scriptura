{"1":"Then said the Lord to me, Goe yet, and loue a woman (beloued of her husbande, and was an harlot) according to the loue of the Lorde toward the children of Israel: yet they looked to other gods, and loued the wine bottels.","2":"So I bought her to me for fifteene pieces of siluer, and for an homer of barlie and an halfe homer of barlie.","3":"And I said vnto her, Thou shalt abide with me many dayes: thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt be to none other man, and I will be so vnto thee.","4":"For the children of Israel shall remaine many dayes without a King & without a prince, and without an offering, and without an image, and without an Ephod and without Teraphim.","5":"Afterward shall the children of Israel conuert, and seeke the Lorde their God, and Dauid their King, and shall feare the Lord, and his goodnes in the latter dayes."}
