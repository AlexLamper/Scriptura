{"1":"Be yee followers of mee, euen as I am of Christ.","2":"Now brethren, I commend you, that ye remember all my things, & keepe the ordinances, as I deliuered them to you.","3":"But I wil that ye know, that Christ is the head of euery man: and the man is the womans head: and God is Christs head.","4":"Euery man praying or prophecying hauing any thing on his head, dishonoureth his head.","5":"But euery woman that prayeth or prophecieth bare headed, dishonoureth her head: for it is euen one very thing, as though she were shauen.","6":"Therefore if the woman be not couered, let her also be shorne: and if it be shame for a woman to be shorne or shauen, let her be couered.","7":"For a man ought not to couer his head: for as much as he is the image & glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.","8":"For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.","9":"For the man was not created for the womans sake: but the woman for the mans sake.","10":"Therefore ought the woman to haue power on her head, because of the Angels.","11":"Neuertheles, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord.","12":"For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman: but all things are of God.","13":"Iudge in your selues, Is it comely that a woman pray vnto God vncouered?","14":"Doeth not nature it selfe teach you, that if a man haue long heare, it is a shame vnto him?","15":"But if a woman haue long heare, it is a prayse vnto her: for her heare is giuen her for a couering.","16":"But if any man lust to be contentious, we haue no such custome, neither the Churches of God.","17":"Nowe in this that I declare, I prayse you not, that ye come together, not with profite, but with hurt.","18":"For first of all, when ye come together in the Church, I heare that there are dissentions among you: and I beleeue it to be true in some part.","19":"For there must be heresies euen among you, that they which are approoued among you, might be knowen.","20":"When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper.","21":"For euery man when they should eate, taketh his owne supper afore, and one is hungry, and another is drunken.","22":"Haue ye not houses to eate & to drinke in? despise ye the Church of God, and shame them that haue not? what shal I say to you? shall I prayse you in this? I prayse you not.","23":"For I haue receiued of the Lorde that which I also haue deliuered vnto you, to wit, That the Lorde Iesus in the night when he was betrayed, tooke bread:","24":"And when hee had giuen thankes, hee brake it, and sayde, Take, eate: this is my body, which is broken for you: this doe ye in remembrance of me.","25":"After the same maner also he tooke the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the Newe Testament in my blood: this doe as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me.","26":"For as often as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye shewe the Lords death till hee come.","27":"Wherefore, whosoeuer shall eate this bread, and drinke the cup of the Lord vnworthily, shall be guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord.","28":"Let euery man therefore examine himselfe, and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup.","29":"For he that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, because he discerneth not the Lords body.","30":"For this cause many are weake, & sicke among you, and many sleepe.","31":"For if we would iudge our selues, we should not be iudged.","32":"But when we are iudged, we are chastened of the Lord, because we should not be condemned with the world.","33":"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eate, tary one for another.","34":"And if any man be hungry, let him eate at home, that ye come not together vnto condemnation. Other things will I set in order when I come."}
