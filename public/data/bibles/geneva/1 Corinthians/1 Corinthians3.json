{"1":"And I could not speake vnto you, brethren, as vnto spirituall men, but as vnto carnall, euen as vnto babes in Christ.","2":"I gaue you milke to drinke, & not meat: for yee were not yet able to beare it, neither yet nowe are yee able.","3":"For yee are yet carnall: for whereas there is among you enuying, and strife, and diuisions, are ye not carnall, and walke as men?","4":"For when one sayeth, I am Pauls, and another, I am Apollos, are yee not carnall?","5":"Who is Paul then? And who is Apollos, but the ministers by whome yee beleeued, and as the Lord gaue to euery man?","6":"I haue planted, Apollos watred, but God gaue the increase.","7":"So then, neither is hee that planteth any thing, neither hee that watreth, but God that giueth the increase.","8":"And he that planteth, and he that watreth, are one, and euery man shall receiue his wages, according to his labour.","9":"For we together are Gods labourers: yee are Gods husbandrie, and Gods building.","10":"According to the grace of God giuen to mee, as a skilfull master builder, I haue laide the foundation, & another buildeth thereon: but let euery man take heede how he buildeth vpon it.","11":"For other foundation can no man laie, then that which is laied, which is Iesus Christ.","12":"And if any man builde on this foundation, golde, siluer, precious stones, timber, haye, or stubble,","13":"Euery mans worke shalbe made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shalbe reueiled by the fire: and the fire shall trie euery mans worke of what sort it is.","14":"If any mans worke, that he hath built vpon, abide, he shall receiue wages.","15":"If any mans worke burne, he shall lose, but he shalbe saued himselfe: neuerthelesse yet as it were by the fire.","16":"Knowe ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?","17":"If any man destroy the Temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the Temple of God is holy, which ye are.","18":"Let no man deceiue himselfe: If any man among you seeme to be wise in this world, let him be a foole, that he may be wise.","19":"For the wisdome of this worlde is foolishnesse with God: for it is written, He catcheth the wise in their owne craftinesse.","20":"And againe, The Lord knoweth that the thoughtes of the wise be vaine.","21":"Therefore let no man reioyce in men: for all things are yours.","22":"Whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death: whether they be things present, or thinges to come, euen all are yours,","23":"And ye Christes, and Christ Gods."}
