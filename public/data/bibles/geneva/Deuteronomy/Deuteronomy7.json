{"1":"When the Lorde thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possesse it, and shall roote out many nations before thee: the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites, seuen nations greater and mightier then thou,","2":"And the Lord thy God shal giue them before thee, then thou shalt smite them: thou shalt vtterly destroy them: thou shalt make no couenant with them, nor haue compassion on them,","3":"Neither shalt thou make marriages with them, neither giue thy daughter vnto his sonne, nor take his daughter vnto thy sonne.","4":"For they wil cause thy sonne to turne away from me, and to serue other gods: then will the wrath of the Lord waxe hote against you and destroy thee suddenly.","5":"But thus ye shal deale with them, Ye shal ouerthrowe their altars, and breake downe their pillars, and ye shall cut downe their groues, and burne their grauen images with fire.","6":"For thou art an holy people vnto the Lord thy God, the Lorde thy God hath chosen thee, to be a precious people vnto himselfe, aboue all people that are vpon the earth.","7":"The Lord did not set his loue vpon you, nor chose you, because ye were mo in number then any people: for ye were the fewest of all people:","8":"But because the Lord loued you, and because hee would keepe the othe which hee had sworne vnto your fathers, the Lord hath brought you out by a mightie hand, and deliuered you out of the house of bondage from the hand of Pharaoh King of Egypt,","9":"That thou mayest knowe, that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithfull God which keepeth couenant and mercie vnto them that loue him and keepe his commaundements, euen to a thousand generations,","10":"And rewardeth them to their face that hate him, to bring them to destruction: he wil not deferre to reward him that hateth him, to his face.","11":"Keepe thou therefore the commaundements, and the ordinances, and the lawes, which I commaund thee this day to doe them.","12":"For if ye hearken vnto these lawes, and obserue and doe them, then the Lorde thy God shal keepe with thee the couenant, and the mercie which he sware vnto thy fathers.","13":"And he wil loue thee, and blesse thee, and multiplie thee: he will also blesse the fruite of thy wombe, and the fruite of thy land, thy corne and thy wine, and thine oyle and the increase of thy kine, and the flockes of thy sheepe in the land, which he sware vnto thy fathers to giue thee.","14":"Thou shalt be blessed aboue all people: there shall be neither male nor female barren among you, nor among your cattell.","15":"Moreouer, the Lorde will take away from thee all infirmities, and will put none of the euill diseases of Egypt (which thou knowest) vpon thee, but wil send them vpon all that hate thee.","16":"Thou shalt therefore consume all people which the Lord thy God shall giue thee: thine eye shall not spare them, neither shalt thou serue their gods, for that shalbe thy destruction.","17":"If thou say in thine heart, These nations are moe then I, how can I cast them out?","18":"Thou shalt not feare them, but remember what the Lord thy God did vnto Pharaoh, and vnto all Egypt:","19":"The great tentations which thine eyes sawe, and the signes and wonders, and the mighty hand and stretched out arme, whereby the Lorde thy God brought thee out: so shall the Lord thy God do vnto all ye people, whose face thou fearest.","20":"Moreouer, the Lorde thy God will send hornets among them vntil they that are left, and hide themselues from thee, be destroyed.","21":"Thou shalt not feare them: for the Lorde thy God is among you, a God mightie & dreadful.","22":"And the Lord thy God wil roote out these nations before thee by little & little: thou mayest not consume them at once, least the beasts of the fielde increase vpon thee.","23":"But the Lord thy God shall giue them before thee, and shall destroy them with a mightie destruction, vntill they be brought to naught.","24":"And he shall deliuer their Kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from vnder heauen: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, vntill thou hast destroyed them.","25":"The grauen images of their gods shall ye burne with fire, and couet not the siluer and golde, that is on them, nor take it vnto thee, least thou be snared therewith: for it is an abomination before the Lord thy God.","26":"Bring not therefore abomination into thine house, lest, thou be accursed like it, but vtterly abhorre it, and count it most abominable: for it is accursed."}
