{"1":"If thou shalt obey diligently the voyce of the Lord thy God, and obserue and do all his commandements, which I commande thee this day, then the Lorde thy God wil set thee on high aboue all the nations of the earth.","2":"And all these blessings shal come on thee, and ouertake thee, if thou shalt obey the voyce of the Lord thy God.","3":"Blessed shalt thou be in the citie, & blessed also in the fielde.","4":"Blessed shalbe the fruite of thy body, and ye fruite of thy ground, & the fruite of thy cattel, the increase of thy kine, & ye flocks of thy sheepe.","5":"Blessed shalbe thy basket and thy dough.","6":"Blessed shalt thou be, whe thou commest in, and blessed also when thou goest out.","7":"The Lorde shall cause thine enemies that rise against thee, to fall before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and shall flee before thee leuen wayes.","8":"The Lord shal command the blessing to be with thee in thy store houses, and in all that thou settest thine hande to, and wil blesse thee in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee.","9":"The Lorde shal make thee an holy people vnto himself, as he hath sworne vnto thee, if thou shalt keepe the commandements of the Lord thy God, and walke in his wayes.","10":"Then all people of the earth shall see that the Name of the Lord is called vpon ouer thee, and they shalbe afrayde of thee.","11":"And the Lord shal make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruite of thy body, and in the fruite of thy cattell, and in the fruite of thy grounde, in the land which the Lorde sware vnto thy fathers, to giue thee.","12":"The Lorde shall open vnto thee his good treasure, euen the heauen to giue rayne vnto thy kind in due season, and to blesse all the worke of thine handes: and thou shalt lende vnto many nations, but shalt not borow thy selfe.","13":"And the Lord shal make thee the head, & not the tayle, & thou shalt be aboue onely, and shalt not bee beneath, if thou obey the commandements of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to keepe and to do them.","14":"But thou shalt not decline from any of the wordes, which I command you this day, either to the right hand or to the left, to goe after other gods to serue them.","15":"But if thou wilt not obey the voyce of the Lord thy God, to keepe & to do all his commandementes and his ordinances, which I command thee this day, then al these curses shal come vpon thee, and ouertake thee.","16":"Cursed shalt thou bee in the towne, and cursed also in the fielde.","17":"Cursed shal thy basket be, & thy dough.","18":"Cursed shall be the fruite of thy body, and the fruite of thy land, the increase of thy kine, & the flockes of thy sheepe.","19":"Cursed shalt thou be when thou commest in, and cursed also when thou goest out.","20":"The Lorde shall sende vpon thee cursing, trouble, & shame, in all that which thou settest thine hand to do, vntil thou be destroyed, and perish quickely, because of the wickednesse of thy workes whereby thou hast forsaken me.","21":"The Lord shall make the pestilence cleaue vnto thee, vntill he hath consumed thee from the land, whither thou goest to possesse it.","22":"The Lorde shall smite thee with a consumption, and with the feuer, and with a burning ague, and with feruent heate, & with the sworde, and with blasting, and with the mildew, & they shal pursue thee vntill thou perish.","23":"And thine heauen that is ouer thine head, shall be brasse, and the earth that is vnder thee, yron.","24":"The Lorde shal giue thee for the rayne of thy land, dust & ashes: euen from heauen shal it come downe vpon thee, vntil thou be destroyed.","25":"And the Lorde shall cause thee to fall before thine enemies: thou shalt come out one way against them, and shalt flee seuen wayes before them, & shalt be scattered through all the kingdomes of the earth.","26":"And thy carkeis shall be meate vnto all foules of the ayre, & vnto the beasts of the earth, and none shal fray them away.","27":"The Lord wil smite thee with the botch of Egypt, & with the emeroids, & with the skab, and with the itche, that thou canst not be healed.","28":"And ye Lorde shal smite thee with madnes, and with blindnes, and with astonying of heart.","29":"Thou shalt also grope at noone daies, as the blinde gropeth in darknes, and shalt not prosper in thy wayes: thou shalt neuer but bee oppressed with wrong and be powled euermore, & no man shal succour thee.","30":"Thou shalt betroth a wife, & another man shal lye with her: thou shalt builde an house, and shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not eate the fruite.","31":"Thine oxe shalbe slayne before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eate thereof: thine asse shall be violently taken away before thy face, and shal not be restored to thee: thy sheepe shalbe giuen vnto thine enemies, and no man shal rescue them for thee.","32":"Thy sonnes & thy daughters shalbe giuen vnto another people, and thine eyes shal still looke for them, euen till they fall out, and there shalbe no power in thine hand.","33":"The fruite of thy land and all thy labours shall a people, which thou knowest not, eate, and thou shalt neuer but suffer wrong, and violence always:","34":"So that thou shalt be madde for the sight which thine eyes shal see.","35":"The Lord shal smite thee in the knees, and in the thighes, with a sore botche, that thou canst not be healed: euen from the sole of thy foote vnto the top of thine head.","36":"The Lord shall bring thee and thy King (which thou shalt set ouer thee) vnto a nation, which neither thou nor thy fathers haue knowen, and there thou shalt serue other gods: euen wood and stone,","37":"And thou shalt be a wonder, a prouerbe and a common talke among all people, whither the Lord shall carie thee.","38":"Thou shalt carie out much seede into the fielde, and shalt gather but litle in: for the grashoppers shall destroy it.","39":"Thou shalt plant a vineyard, and dresse it, but shalt neither drinke of the wine, nor gather the grapes: for the wormes shall eate it.","40":"Thou shalt haue Oliue trees in all thy coastes, but shalt not anoynt thy selfe with the oyle: for thine oliues shall fall.","41":"Thou shalt beget sonnes, and daughters, but shalt not haue them: for they shall goe into captiuitie.","42":"All thy trees and fruite of thy land shall the grashopper consume.","43":"The straunger that is among you, shall clime aboue thee vp on hie, and thou shalt come downe beneath alow.","44":"He shall lend thee, and thou shalt not lend him: he shalbe the head, & thou shalt be ye tayle.","45":"Moreouer, all these curses shall come vpon thee, and shall pursue thee and ouertake thee, till thou be destroyed, because thou obeyedst not the voyce of the Lorde thy God, to keepe his commaundements, and his ordinances, which he commanded thee:","46":"And they shalbe vpon thee for signes & wonders, and vpon thy seede for euer,","47":"Because thou seruedst not the Lorde thy God with ioyfulnesse and with a good heart for the abundance of all things.","48":"Therefore thou shalt serue thine enemies which the Lord shal send vpon thee, in hunger & in thirst, and in nakednesse, and in neede of all things? And he shall put a yoke of yron vpon thy necke vntill he haue destroyed thee.","49":"The Lord shall bring a nation vpon thee from farre, euen from the ende of the world, flying swift as an Egle: a nation whose tongue thou shalt not vnderstand:","50":"A nation of a fierce countenance, which will not regarde the person of the olde, nor haue compassion of the yong.","51":"The same shall eate the fruit of thy cattell, and the fruite of thy land vntill thou be destroyed, and he shall leaue thee neyther wheate, wine, nor oyle, neither the increase of thy kyne, nor the flockes of thy sheepe, vntill he haue brought thee to nought.","52":"And he shall besiege thee in all thy cities, vntill thine hie and strong walles fall downe, wherein thou trustedst in all the lande: and hee shall besiege thee in all thy cities throughout all thy lande, which the Lorde thy God hath giuen thee.","53":"And thou shalt eate the fruite of thy bodie: euen the flesh of thy sonnes and thy daughters, which the Lorde thy God hath giuen thee, during the siege & straitnesse wherein thine enemie shall inclose thee:","54":"So that the man (that is tender and exceeding deintie among you) shalbe grieued at his brother, and at his wife, that lieth in his bosome, and at the remnant of his children, which hee hath yet left,","55":"For feare of giuing vnto any of them of the flesh of his children, whom he shall eate, because he hath nothing left him in that siege, and straitnesse, wherewith thine enemie shall besiege thee in all thy cities.","56":"The tender and deintie woman among you, which neuer woulde venture to set the sole of her foote vpon the grounde (for her softnesse and tendernesse) shalbe grieued at her husbande that lieth in her bosome, and at her sonne, and at her daughter,","57":"And at her afterbirth (that shall come out from betweene her feete) and at her childre, which she shall beare: for when all things lacke, she shall eate them secretly, during the siege and straitnesse, wherewith thine enemie shall besiege thee in thy cities.","58":"If thou wilt not keepe and doe all the wordes of the Lawe (that are written in this booke) and feare this glorious and feareful name The Lord Thy God,","59":"The the Lord wil make thy plagues wonderfull, and the plagues of thy seede, euen great plagues and of long continuance, and sore diseases, and of long durance.","60":"Moreouer, he will bring vpon thee all the diseases of Egypt, whereof thou wast afraide, and they shall cleaue vnto thee.","61":"And euery sickenesse, and euery plague, which is not written in the booke of this Lawe, will the Lorde heape vpon thee, vntill thou be destroyed.","62":"And ye shall be left few in nomber, where ye were as the starres of heauen in multitude, because thou wouldest not obey the voyce of the Lord thy God.","63":"And as the Lord hath reioyced ouer you, to doe you good, and to multiply you, so he will reioyce ouer you, to destroy you, and bring you to nought, and ye shalbe rooted out of the land, whither thou goest to possesse it.","64":"And the Lorde shall scatter thee among all people, from the one ende of the worlde vnto the other, and there thou shalt serue other gods, which thou hast not knowen nor thy fathers, euen wood and stone.","65":"Also among these nations thou shalt finde no rest, neither shall the sole of thy foote haue rest: for the Lord shal giue thee there a trembling heart, and looking to returne till thine eyes fall out, and a sorowfull minde.","66":"And thy life shall hang before thee, and thou shalt feare both night and day, and shalt haue none assurance of thy life.","67":"In the morning thou shalt say, Woulde God it were euening, and at the euening thou shalt say, Would God it were morning, for ye feare of thine heart, which thou shalt feare, and for the sight of thine eyes, which thou shalt see.","68":"And the Lorde shal bring thee into Egypt againe with shippes by the way, whereof I saide vnto thee, Thou shalt see it no more againe: and there yee shall sell your selues vnto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and there shalbe no byer."}
