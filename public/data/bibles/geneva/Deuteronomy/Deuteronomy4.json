{"1":"Nowe therefore hearken, O Israel, vnto the ordinances and to the lawes which I teache you to doe, that ye may liue and goe in, and possesse the lande, which the Lorde God of your fathers giueth you.","2":"Ye shal put nothing vnto the word which I command you, neither shal ye take ought there from, that ye may keepe the commandements of the Lord your God which I commande you.","3":"Your eyes haue seene what the Lord did because of Baal-Peor, for al the men that folowed Baal-Peor the Lord thy God hath destroyed euery one from among you.","4":"But ye that did cleaue vnto the Lord your God, are aliue euery one of you this day.","5":"Behold, I haue taught you ordinances, and lawes, as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should doe euen so within the land whither ye goe to possesse it.","6":"Keepe them therefore, and doe them; for that is your wisdome, and your vnderstanding in the sight of the people, which shall heare all these ordinances, and shall say, Onely this people is wise, and of vnderstanding, and a great nation.","7":"For what nation is so great, vnto whome the gods come so neere vnto them, as the Lorde our God is neere vnto vs, in all that we call vnto him for?","8":"And what nation is so great, that hath ordinances and lawes so righteous, as all this Lawe, which I set before you this day?","9":"But take heede to thy selfe, and keepe thy soule diligently, that thou forget not the thinges which thine eyes haue seene, and that they depart not out of thine heart, all the dayes of thy life: but teach them thy sonnes, and thy sonnes sonnes:","10":"Forget not the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said vnto me, Gather me the people together, and I wil cause them heare my wordes, that they may learne to feare me all the dayes that they shal liue vpon the earth, and that they may teache their children:","11":"Then came you neere and stoode vnder the mountaine, and the mountaine burnt with fire vnto the mids of heauen, and there was darkenesse, cloudes and mist.","12":"And the Lorde spake vnto you out of the middes of the fire, and ye heard the voyce of the wordes, but sawe no similitude, saue a voyce.","13":"Then hee declared vnto you his couenant which he commanded you to doe, euen the ten commaundements, and wrote them vpon two tables of stone.","14":"And the Lord commanded me that same time, that I should teach you ordinances & lawes, which ye should obserue in the lande, whither ye goe, to possesse it.","15":"Take therefore good heede vnto your selues: for ye sawe no image in the day that the Lord spake vnto you in Horeb out of the middes of the fire:","16":"That ye corrupt not your selues, and make you a grauen image or representation of any figure: whither it be the likenes of male or female,","17":"The likenes of any beast that is on earth, or the likenesse of any fethered foule that flieth in the aire:","18":"Or the likenesse of any thing that creepeth on the earth, or the likenesse of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth,","19":"And lest thou lift vp thine eyes vnto heauen, and when thou seest the sunne & the moone and the starres with all the host of heauen, shouldest bee driuen to worship them and serue them, which the Lord thy God hath distributed to all people vnder the whole heauen.","20":"But the Lorde hath taken you and brought you out of the yron fornace: out of Egypt to be vnto him a people and inheritance, as appeareth this day.","21":"And the Lord was angrie with me for your words, and sware that I should not goe ouer Iorden, and that I should not goe in vnto that good land, which the Lord thy God giueth thee for an inheritance.","22":"For I must die in this land, and shall not go ouer Iorden: but ye shall goe ouer, and possesse that good land.","23":"Take heede vnto your selues, least ye forget the couenant of the Lorde your God which hee made with you, and least ye make you any grauen image, or likenes of any thing, as the Lorde thy God hath charged thee.","24":"For the Lorde thy God is a consuming fire, and a ielous God.","25":"When thou shalt beget children and childrens children, and shalt haue remained long in the land, if ye corrupt your selues, and make any grauen image, or likenes of any thing, and worke euill in the sight of the Lord thy God, to prouoke him to anger,","26":"I call heauen and earth to record against you this day, that ye shall shortly perish from the land, whereunto ye goe ouer Iorden to possesse it: ye shall not prolong your dayes therein, but shall vtterly be destroyed.","27":"And the Lord shall scatter you among the people, and ye shall be left few in nomber among the nations, whither the Lord shall bring you:","28":"And there ye shall serue gods, euen ye worke of mans hand, wood, and stone, which neither see, nor heare, nor eate, nor smell.","29":"But if from thence thou shalt seeke the Lord thy God, thou shalt finde him, if thou seeke him with all thine heart, and with all thy soule.","30":"When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come vpon thee, at the length if thou returne to the Lorde thy God, and bee obedient vnto his voyce,","31":"(For the Lord thy God is a mercifull God) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the couenant of thy fathers, which hee sware vnto them.","32":"For inquire now of the dayes that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man vpon the earth, and aske from the one ende of heauen vnto the other, if there came to passe such a great thing as this, or whether any such like thing hath bene heard.","33":"Did euer people heare the voyce of God speaking out of the middes of a fire, as thou hast heard, and liued?","34":"Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from among nations, by tentations, by signes, and by wonders, and by warre, and by a mightie hand, and by a stretched out arme, & by great feare, according vnto all that the Lord your God did vnto you in Egypt before your eyes?","35":"Vnto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest knowe, that the Lorde hee is God, and that there is none but he alone.","36":"Out of heauen hee made thee heare his voyce to instruct thee, and vpon earth he shewed thee his great fire, and thou heardest his voyce out of the middes of the fire.","37":"And because hee loued thy fathers, therefore hee chose their seede after them, and hath brought thee out of Egypt in his sight by his mightie power,","38":"To thrust out nations greater and mightier then thou, before thee, to bring thee in, and to giue thee their land for inheritance: as appeareth this day.","39":"Vnderstande therefore this day, and consider in thine heart, that the Lord, he is God in heauen aboue, and vpon the earth beneath: there is none other.","40":"Thou shalt keepe therefore his ordinances, and his commaundements which I commaunde thee this day, that it may goe well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayst prolong thy dayes vpon the earth, which the Lord thy God giueth thee for euer.","41":"Then Moses separated three cities on this side of Iorden toward the sunne rising:","42":"That the slayer should flee thither, which had killed his neighbour at vnwares, and hated him not in time past, might flee, I say, vnto one of those cities, and liue:","43":"That is, Bezer in the wildernesse, in the plaine countrey of the Reubenites: and Ramoth in Gilead among the Gadites: and Golan in Bashan among them of Manasseh.","44":"So this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.","45":"These are the witnesses, and the ordinances, and the lawes which Moses declared to the children of Israel after they came out of Egypt,","46":"On this side Iorden, in the valley ouer against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon King of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come out of Egypt:","47":"And they possessed his land, and the lande of Og King of Bashan, two Kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Iorden towarde the sunne rising:","48":"From Aroer, which is by the banke of the riuer Arnon, euen vnto mount Sion, which is Hermon,","49":"And all the plaine by Iorden Eastwarde, euen vnto the Sea, of ye plaine, vnder the springs of Pisgah."}
