and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt doe that which is right in the sight of the Lord:","26":"But thine holy things which thou hast, and thy vowes thou shalt take vp, and come vnto the place which the Lord shall chuse.","27":"And thou shalt make thy burnt offerings of the flesh, and of the blood vpon the altar of the Lorde thy God, and the blood of thine offerings shall bee powred vpon the altar of the Lorde thy God, and thou shalt eate the flesh.","28":"Take heede, and heare all these woordes which I commaund thee, that it may goe well with thee, & with thy children after thee for euer, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the Lord thy God.","29":"When the Lorde thy God shall destroy the nations before thee, whither thou goest to possesse them, and thou shalt possesse them and dwell in their lande,","30":"Beware, lest thou be taken in a snare after them, after that they be destroied before thee, and lest thou aske after their gods, saying, Howe did these nations serue their gods, that I may doe so likewise?","31":"Thou shalt not doe so vnto the Lorde thy God: for al abomination, which the Lord hateth, haue they done vnto their gods: for they haue burned both their sonnes and their daughters with fire to their gods.","32":"Therefore whatsoeuer I command you, take heede you doe it: thou shalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom."}
