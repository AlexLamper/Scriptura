{"1":"Heare O Israel, Thou shalt passe ouer Iorden this day, to goe in and to possesse nations greater and mightier then thy selfe, and cities great and walled vp to heauen,","2":"A people great and tall, euen the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak?","3":"Vnderstand therefore that this day ye Lorde thy God is he which goeth ouer before thee as a consuming fire: he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them downe before thy face: so thou shalt cast them out and destroy them suddenly, as the Lord hath said vnto thee.","4":"Speake not thou in thine heart (after that the Lord thy God hath cast them out before thee) saying, For my righteousnesse the Lorde hath brought me in, to possesse this land: but for the wickednesse of these nations the Lorde hath cast them out before thee.","5":"For thou entrest not to inherite their lande for thy righteousnesse, or for thy vpright heart: but for the wickednesse of those nations, the Lord thy God doth cast them out before thee, and that he might performe the worde which the Lord thy God sware vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Iacob.","6":"Vnderstand therefore, that ye Lord thy God giueth thee not this good land to possesse it for thy righteousnes: for thou art a stifnecked people.","7":"Remember, and forget not, howe thou prouokedst the Lord thy God to anger in the wildernesse: since the day that thou diddest depart out of the land of Egypt, vntill ye came vnto this place ye haue rebelled against the Lord.","8":"Also in Horeb ye prouoked the Lorde to anger so that the Lord was wroth with you, euen to destroy you.","9":"When I was gone vp into the mount, to receiue the tables of stone, the tables, I say, of the couenant, which the Lord made with you: and I abode in the mount fourtie daies & fourtie nights, and I neither ate bread nor yet dranke water:","10":"Then the Lorde deliuered me two tables of stone, written with the finger of God, and in them was conteyned according to all the wordes which the Lorde had said vnto you in the mount out of the middes of the fire, in the day of the assemblie.","11":"And when the fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes were ended, the Lorde gaue me the two tables of stone, the tables, I say, of the couenant.","12":"And the Lord said vnto me, Arise, get thee downe quickly from hence: for thy people which thou hast brought out of Egypt, haue corrupt their wayes: they are soone turned out of the way, which I commanded them: they haue made them a molten image.","13":"Furthermore, the Lord spake vnto me, saying, I haue seene this people, and beholde, it is a stifnecked people.","14":"Let me alone, that I may destroy them, & put out their name fro vnder heaue, & I wil make of thee a mightie nation, & greater then they be.","15":"So I returned, and came downe from the Mount (and the Mount burnt with fire, and ye two Tables of the couenant were in my two handes)","16":"Then I looked, and beholde, ye had sinned against the Lord your God: for ye had made you a molten calfe, and had turned quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you.","17":"Therefore I tooke the two Tables, and cast them out of my two handes, and brake them before your eyes.","18":"And I fell downe before the Lorde, fourtie dayes, and fourtie nightes, as before: I neither ate bread nor dranke water, because of al your sinnes, which ye had committed, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lorde, in that ye prouoked him vnto wrath.","19":"(For I was afraide of the wrath and indignation, wherewith the Lord was mooued against you, euen to destroy you) yet the Lord heard me at that time also.","20":"Likewise ye Lorde was very angrie with Aaron, euen to destroy him: but at that time I prayed also for Aaron.","21":"And I tooke your sinne, I meane the calfe which ye had made, and burnt him with fire, and stamped him and ground him small, euen vnto very dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the riuer, that descended out of the mount.","22":"Also in Taberah, & in Massah and in Kibrothhattaauah ye prouoked ye Lord to anger.","23":"Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Goe vp, and possesse the land which I haue giuen you, then ye rebelled against the commandement of the Lord your God, and beleeued him not, nor hearkened vnto his voyce.","24":"Ye haue bene rebellious vnto the Lorde, since the day that I knewe you.","25":"Then I fell downe before ye Lorde fourtie dayes & fourtie nightes, as I fell downe before, because ye Lord had said, that he woulde destroy you.","26":"And I prayed vnto the Lorde, and saide, O Lord God, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatnesse, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt by a mightie hand.","27":"Remember thy seruants Abraham, Izhak, & Iaakob: looke not to ye stubburnes of this people, nor to their wickednes, nor to their sinne,","28":"Lest the countrey, whence thou broughtest them, say, Because ye Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, or because he hated them, he caried them out, to slay them in the wildernesse.","29":"Yet they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mightie power, and by thy stretched out arme."}
