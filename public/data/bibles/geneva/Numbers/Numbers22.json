{"1":"After, the children of Israel departed & pitched in the plaine of Moab on the other side of Iorden from Iericho.","2":"Now Balak the sonne of Zippor sawe all that Israel had done to the Amorites.","3":"And the Moabites were sore afraide of the people, because they were many, and Moab fretted against the children of Israel.","4":"Therfore Moab said vnto the Elders of Midian, Nowe shall this multitude licke vp all that are round about vs, as an oxe licketh vp ye grasse of the fielde: and Balak the sonne of Zippor was King of the Moabites at that time.","5":"Hee sent messengers therefore vnto Balaam the sonne of Beor to Pethor (which is by the riuer of the lande of the children of his folke) to call him, saying, Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt, which couer the face of the earth, and lye ouer against me.","6":"Come now therefore, I pray thee, and curse me this people (for they are stronger then I) so it may be that I shall be able to smite them, and to driue them out of the land: for I knowe that hee, whome thou blessest, is blessed, and he whom thou cursest, shall be cursed.","7":"And the Elders of Moab, and the Elders of Midian departed, hauing the reward of the soothsaying in their hande, and they came vnto Balaam, and tolde him the wordes of Balak.","8":"Who answered them, Tary here this night, and I will giue you an answere, as the Lorde shall say vnto mee. So the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.","9":"Then God came vnto Balaam, and sayde, What men are these with thee?","10":"And Baalam said vnto God, Balak ye sonne of Zippor, king of Moab hath set vnto me, saying,","11":"Beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt and couereth the face of the earth: come nowe, curse them for my sake: so it may be that I shalbe able to ouercome them in battell, and to driue them out.","12":"And God said vnto Balaam, Go not thou with them, neither curse the people, for they are blessed.","13":"And Balaam rose vp in the morning, and sayde vnto ye princes of Balak, Returne vnto your land: for the Lord hath refused to giue me leaue to go with you.","14":"So the princes of Moab rose vp, and went vnto Balak, & sayd, Balaam hath refused to come with vs.","15":"Balak yet sent againe moe princes, and more honourable then they.","16":"Who came to Balaam, and sayde to him, Thus saith Balak the sonne of Zippor, Bee not thou staied, I pray thee, from coming vnto me.","17":"For I wil promote thee vnto great honour, and wil do whatsoeuer thou sayest vnto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.","18":"And Balaam answered, and sayde vnto the seruants of Balak, If Balak woulde giue me his house full of siluer and golde, I can not goe beyonde the worde of the Lorde my God, to doe lesse or more.","19":"But nowe, I pray you, tary here this night, that I may wit, what the Lorde will say vnto mee more.","20":"And God came vnto Balaam by night, and sayd vnto him, If the men come to call thee, rise vp, and goe with them: but onely what thing I say vnto thee, that shalt thou doe.","21":"So Balaam rose vp early, and sadled his asse, and went with the princes of Moab.","22":"And ye wrath of God was kindled, because he went: and the Angel of the Lord stood in the way to be against him, as he rode vpon his asse, & his two seruants were with him.","23":"And when the asse saw the Angel of the Lord stand in the way, and his sworde drawen in his hand, the asse turned out of the way and went into the field, but Balaam smote the asse, to turne her into the way.","24":"Againe the Angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyardes, hauing a wall on the one side, and a wall on the other.","25":"And when the asse sawe the Angel of the Lord, she thrust her selfe vnto the wall, and dasht Balaams foote against the wall: wherefore hee smote her againe.","26":"Then the Angel of the Lord went further, & stoode in a narowe place, where was no way to turne, either to the right hand, or to the left.","27":"And when the asse sawe the Angell of the Lorde, she lay downe vnder Balaam: therefore Balaam was very wroth, and smote the asse with a staffe.","28":"Then the Lorde opened the mouth of the asse, and she saide vnto Balaam, What haue I done vnto thee, that thou hast smitten me nowe three times?","29":"And Balaam saide vnto the asse, Because thou hast mocked me: I woulde there were a sworde in mine hand, for nowe would I kill thee.","30":"And the asse saide vnto Balaam, Am not I thine asse, which thou hast ridden vpon since thy first time vnto this day? haue I vsed at any time to doe thus vnto thee? Who said, Nay.","31":"And the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he sawe the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with his sword drawen in his hande: then he bowed him selfe, and fell flat on his face.","32":"And the Angel of the Lord said vnto him, Wherefore hast thou nowe smitten thine asse three times? beholde, I came out to withstande thee, because thy way is not straight before me.","33":"But the asse sawe me, and turned fro me now three times: for els, if she had not turned fro me, surely I had euen nowe slaine thee, and saued her aliue.","34":"Then Balaam saide vnto the Angel of the Lorde, I haue sinned: for I wist not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore if it displease thee, I will turne home againe.","35":"But the Angel said vnto Balaam, Go with the men: but what I say vnto thee, that shalt thou speake. So Balaam went with ye princes of Balak.","36":"And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meete him vnto a citie of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, euen in the vtmost coast.","37":"Then Balak saide vnto Balaam, Did I not sende for thee to call thee? Wherefore camest thou not vnto me? am I not able in deede to promote thee vnto honour?","38":"And Balaam made answere vnto Balak, Lo, I am come vnto thee, and can I nowe say any thing at all? the worde that God putteth in my mouth, that shal I speake.","39":"So Balaam went with Balak, & they came vnto the citie of Huzoth.","40":"Then Balak offred bullockes, and sheepe, and sent thereof to Balaam, & to the princes that were with him.","41":"And on the morowe Balak tooke Balaam, and brought him vp into the hie places of Baal, that thence hee might see the vtmost part of the people."}
