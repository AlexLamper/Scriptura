{"1":"When King Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt toward the South, heard tel that Israel came by the way of the spies, then fought hee against Israel, and tooke of them prysoners.","2":"So Israel vowed a vowe vnto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt deliuer and giue this people into mine hand, then I wil vtterly destroy their cities.","3":"And the Lord heard the voyce of Israel, and deliuered them the Canaanites: and they vtterly destroied them and their cities, and called ye name of the place Hormah.","4":"After, they departed from the mount Hor by the way of the red Sea, to compasse the land of Edom: and the people were sore grieued because of the way.","5":"And the people spake against God and against Moses, saying, Wherefore haue ye brought vs out of Egypt, to die in the wildernesse? for here is neither bread nor water, & our soule lotheth this light bread.","6":"Wherefore the Lorde sent fierie serpents among ye people, which stung the people: so that many of the people of Israel died.","7":"Therefore the people came to Moses & said, We haue sinned: for wee haue spoken against the Lord, and against thee: pray to the Lorde, that he take away the serpents from vs: and Moses prayed for the people.","8":"And the Lord said vnto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it vp for a signe, that as many as are bitten, may looke vpon it, and liue.","9":"So Moses made a serpent of brasse, and set it vp for a signe: and when a serpent had bitten a man, then he looked to the serpent of brasse, and liued.","10":"And ye children of Israel departed thence, and pitched in Oboth.","11":"And they departed from Oboth, & pitched in lie-abarim, in the wildernesse, which is before Moab on the Eastside.","12":"They remoued thence, and pitched vpon the riuer of Zared.","13":"Thence they departed, & pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wildernesse, and commeth out of the coasts of the Amorites: (for Arnon is the border of Moab, betweene the Moabites and the Amorites)","14":"Wherefore it shall be spoken in the booke of the battels of the Lorde, what thing he did in the red sea, and in the riuers of Arnon,","15":"And at the streame of the riuers that goeth downe to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth vpon the border of Moab.","16":"And from thence they turned to Beer: the same is the well where the Lord said vnto Moses, Assemble the people, and I wil giue them water.","17":"Then Israel sang this song, Rise vp wel, sing ye vnto it.","18":"The princes digged this well, the captaines of the people digged it, euen the lawe giuer, with their staues; from the wildernesse they came to Mattanah,","19":"And from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,","20":"And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the plaine of Moab, to the top of Pisgah that looketh toward Ieshimon.","21":"Then Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon, King of the Amorites, saying,","22":"Let me goe through thy land: we wil not turne aside into the fieldes, nor into the vineyardes, neither drinke of the waters of ye welles: we will goe by the kings way, vntill we be past thy countrey.","23":"But Sihon gaue Israel no licence to passe through his countrey, but Sihon assembled all his people, and went out against Israel into the wildernesse: and he came to Iahoz, and fought against Israel.","24":"But Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and conquered his land, from Arnon vnto Iabok, euen vnto ye children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.","25":"And Israel tooke al these cities, & dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all the villages thereof.","26":"For Heshbon was the citie of Sihon the king of the Amorites, which had fought beforetime against the king of the Moabites, & had taken al his land out of his hand, euen vnto Arnon.","27":"Wherefore they that speake in prouerbes, say, Come to Heshbon, let the citie of Sihon bee built and repaired:","28":"For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, and a flame from the citie of Sihon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the lords of Bamoth in Arnon.","29":"Wo be to thee, Moab: O people of Chemosh, thou art vndone: he hath suffered his sonnes to be pursued, and his daughters to be in captiuitie to Sihon the king of the Amorites.","30":"Their empire also is lost from Heshbon vnto Dibon, and wee haue destroyed them vnto Nophah, which reacheth vnto Medeba.","31":"Thus Israel dwelt in the lande of the Amorites.","32":"And Moses sent to searche out Iaazer, and they tooke the townes belonging thereto, and rooted out the Amorites that were there.","33":"And they turned and went vp toward Bashan: and Og the King of Bashan came out against them, hee, and all his people, to fight at Edrei.","34":"Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Feare him not: for I haue deliuered him into thine hand and all his people, and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou diddest vnto Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.","35":"They smote him therefore, and his sonnes, and all his people, vntill there was none left him: so they conquered his land."}
