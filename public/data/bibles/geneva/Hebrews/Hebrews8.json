{"1":"Nowe of the things which we haue spoken, this is the summe, that wee haue such an hie Priest, that sitteth at the right hand of the throne of the Maiestie in heauens,","2":"And is a minister of the Sanctuarie, and of that true Tabernacle which the Lorde pight, and not man.","3":"For euery high Priest is ordeined to offer both giftes and sacrifices: wherefore it was of necessitie, that this man shoulde haue somewhat also to offer.","4":"For he were not a Priest, if he were on the earth, seeing there are Priestes that according to the Lawe offer giftes,","5":"Who serue vnto the paterne and shadowe of heauenly things, as Moses was warned by God, whe he was about to finish the Tabernacle. See, saide hee, that thou make all thinges according to the paterne, shewed to thee in the mount.","6":"But nowe our hie Priest hath obteined a more excellent office, in as much as he is the Mediatour of a better Testament, which is established vpon better promises.","7":"For if that first Testament had bene vnblameable, no place should haue bene sought for the second.","8":"For in rebuking them he saith, Beholde, the dayes will come, saith the Lorde, when I shall make with the house of Israel, & with the house of Iuda a newe Testament:","9":"Not like the Testament that I made with their fathers, in the day that I tooke them by the hand, to leade them out of the land of Egypt: for they continued not in my Testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.","10":"For this is the Testament that I will make with the house of Israel, After those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my Lawes in their minde, and in their heart I will write them, and I wil be their God, and they shalbe my people,","11":"And they shall not teache euery man his neighbour and euery man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall knowe me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.","12":"For I will bee mercifull to their vnrighteousnes, and I wil remember their sinnes and their iniquities no more.","13":"In that he saith a new Testament, he hath abrogate the olde: nowe that which is disanulled and waxed olde, is ready to vanish away."}
