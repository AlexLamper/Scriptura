{"1":"Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heauenly vocation, consider the Apostle and high Priest of our profession Christ Iesus:","2":"Who was faithfull to him that hath appointed him, euen as Moses was in al his house.","3":"For this man is counted worthy of more glory then Moses, inasmuch as he which hath builded the house, hath more honour then the house.","4":"For euery house is builded of some man, and he that hath built all things, is God.","5":"Now Moses verely was faithfull in all his house, as a seruant, for a witnesse of the thinges which should be spoken after.","6":"But Christ is as the Sonne, ouer his owne house, whose house we are, if we holde fast that confidence and that reioycing of that hope vnto the ende.","7":"Wherefore, as the holy Ghost sayth, To day if ye shall heare his voyce,","8":"Harden not your hearts, as in the prouocation, according to the day of the tentation in the wildernes,","9":"Where your fathers tempted me, prooued me, and sawe my workes fourtie yeeres long.","10":"Wherefore I was grieued with that generation, and sayde, They erre euer in their heart, neither haue they knowen my wayes.","11":"Therefore I sware in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest.","12":"Take heede, brethren, least at any time there be in any of you an euill heart, and vnfaithfull, to depart away from the liuing God.","13":"But exhort one another dayly, while it is called to day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulnes of sinne.","14":"For we are made partakers of Christ, if we keepe sure vnto the ende that beginning, wherewith we are vpholden,","15":"So long as it is sayd, To day if ye heare his voyce, harden not your hearts, as in the prouocation.","16":"For some when they heard, prouoked him to anger: howbeit, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.","17":"But with whome was he displeased fourtie yeeres? Was hee not displeased with them that sinned, whose carkeises fell in the wildernes?","18":"And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but vnto them that obeyed not?","19":"So we see that they could not enter in, because of vnbeliefe."}
