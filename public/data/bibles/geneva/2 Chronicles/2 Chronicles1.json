{"1":"Then Salomon the sonne of Dauid was confirmed in his kingdome: and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him highly.","2":"And Salomon spake vnto all Israel, to the captaines of thousandes, and of hundreths, and to the iudges, and to all the gouernours in all Israel, euen the chiefe fathers.","3":"So Salomon and all the Congregation with him went to the hie place that was at Gibeon: for there was the Tabernacle of the Congregation of God which Moses the seruant of the Lord had made in the wildernesse.","4":"But the Arke of God had Dauid brought vp from Kiriath-iearim, when Dauid had made preparation for it: for he had pitched a tent for it in Ierusalem.","5":"Moreouer the brasen altar that Bezaleel the sonne of Vri, the sonne of Hur had made, did hee set before the Tabernacle of the Lorde: and Salomon and the Congregation sought it.","6":"And Salomon offred there before the Lord vpon the brasen altar that was in the Tabernacle of the Congregation: euen a thousand burnt offrings offred he vpon it.","7":"The same night did God appeare vnto Salomon, and sayde vnto him, Aske what I shall giue thee.","8":"And Salomon sayde vnto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy vnto Dauid my father and hast made me to reigne in his stead.","9":"Nowe therefore, O Lorde God, let thy promes vnto Dauid my father be true: for thou hast made mee King ouer a great people, like to the dust of the earth.","10":"Giue me now wisdome & knowledge, that I may go out and go in before this people: for who can iudge this thy great people?","11":"And God sayde to Salomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, treasures nor honour, nor the liues of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life, but hast asked for thee wisdome & knowledge that thou mightest iudge my people, ouer whome I haue made thee King,","12":"Wisdome and knowledge is granted vnto thee, and I will giue thee riches and treasures and honour, so that there hath not bene the like among the Kings which were before thee, neither after thee shal there be the like.","13":"Then Salomon came from the hie place, that was at Gibeon, to Ierusalem from before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and reigned ouer Israel.","14":"And Salomon gathered the charets and horesemen: and he had a thousand and foure hundreth charets, and twelue thousande horsemen, whome he placed in the charet cities, and with the King at Ierusalem.","15":"And the King gaue siluer and gold at Ierusalem as stones, & gaue cedar trees as the wilde figge trees, that are abundantly in the playne.","16":"Also Salomon had horses brought out of Egypt & fine linen: the Kings marchants receiued the fine linen for a price.","17":"They came vp also and brought out of Egypt some charet, worth sixe hundreth shekels of siluer, that is an horse for an hundreth and fiftie: and thus they brought horses to all the Kings of the Hittites, and to the Kings of Aram by their meanes."}
