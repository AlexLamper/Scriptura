{"1":"After these things faithfully described, Saneherib King of Asshur came and entred into Iudah, and besieged the strong cities, & thought to winne them for him selfe.","2":"When Hezekiah sawe that Saneherib was come, and that his purpose was to fight against Ierusalem,","3":"Then he tooke counsell with his princes and his nobles, to stoppe the water of the fountaines without the citie: and they did helpe him.","4":"So many of the people assembled themselues, and stopt all the fountaines, and the riuer that ranne through the middes of the countrey, saying, Why should the Kings of Asshur come, and finde much water?","5":"And he tooke courage, and built all the broken wall, and made vp the towers, and another wall without, and repayred Millo in the citie of Dauid, & made many dartes & shields.","6":"And he set captaines of warre ouer the people, and assembled them to him in the broade place of the gate of the citie, and spake comfortably vnto them, saying,","7":"Be strong and couragious: feare not, neither be afraide for the King of Asshur, neither for all the multitude that is with him: for there be mo with vs, then is with him.","8":"With him is an arme of flesh, but with vs is the Lord our God for to helpe vs, & to fight our battels. Then the people were confirmed by the wordes of Hezekiah King of Iudah.","9":"After this, did Saneherib King of Asshur send his seruants to Ierusalem (while he was against Lachish, and all his dominion with him) vnto Hezekiah King of Iudah and vnto all Iudah that were at Ierusalem, saying,","10":"Thus saith Saneherib the King of Asshur, Wherein doe ye trust, that ye will remaine in Ierusalem, during the siege?","11":"Doeth not Hezekiah entice you to giue ouer your selues vnto death by famine and by thirst, saying, The Lorde our God shall deliuer vs out of the hande of the King of Asshur?","12":"Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his hie places and his altars, and commaunded Iudah and Ierusalem, saying, Ye shall worshippe before one altar, and burne incense vpon it?","13":"Knowe ye not what I and my fathers haue done vnto all the people of other countreyes? Were the gods of the nations of other landes able to deliuer their land out of mine hande?","14":"Who is he of al the gods of those natios (that my fathers haue destroied) that could deliuer his people out of mine hande? That your God should be able to deliuer you out of mine hand?","15":"Nowe therefore let not Hezekiah deceiue you, nor seduce you after this sort, neither beleeue ye him: for none of all the gods of any nation or kingdome was able to deliuer his people out of mine hande and out of the hande of my fathers: howe much lesse shall your gods deliuer you out of mine hande?","16":"And his seruants spake yet more against the Lorde God, and against his seruant Hezekiah.","17":"He wrote also letters, blaspheming the Lorde God of Israel and speaking against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other countreies could not deliuer their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliuer his people out of mine hande.","18":"Then they cryed with a loude voyce in the Iewes speech vnto the people of Ierusalem that were on the wall, to feare them and to astonish them, that they might take the citie.","19":"Thus they spake against the God of Ierusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, euen the workes of mans hands,","20":"But Hezekiah the King, and the Prophet Isaiah the sonne of Amoz prayed against this and cryed to heauen.","21":"And the Lorde sent an Angel which destroyed all the valiant men, and the princes and captaines of the hoste of the King of Asshur: so he returned with shame to his owne lande; when he was come into the house of his god, they that came foorth of his owne bowels, slewe him there with the sworde.","22":"So the Lorde saued Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem from the hande of Saneherib King of Asshur, and from the hande of all other, and maintained them on euery side.","23":"And many brought offrings vnto the Lord to Ierusalem, and presents to Hezekiah King of Iudah, so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thencefoorth.","24":"In those dayes Hezekiah was sicke vnto the death, and prayed vnto the Lorde, who spake vnto him, and gaue him a signe.","25":"But Hezekiah did not render according to the rewarde bestowed vpon him: for his heart was lift vp, and wrath came vpon him, and vpon Iudah and Ierusalem.","26":"Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled him selfe (after that his heart was lifted vp) he and the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and the wrath of the Lorde came not vpon them in the dayes of Hezekiah.","27":"Hezekiah also had exceeding much riches and honour, and he gate him treasures of siluer, and of golde, and of precious stones, and of sweete odours, and of shieldes, and of all pleasant vessels:","28":"And of store houses for the increase of wheat and wine & oyle, and stalles for all beasts, and rowes for the stables.","29":"And he made him cities, and had possession of sheepe and oxen in abundance: for God had giuen him substance exceeding much.","30":"This same Hezekiah also stopped the vpper water springs of Gihon, & led them streight vnderneath towarde the citie of Dauid Westwarde. so Hezekiah prospered in all his workes.","31":"But because of the ambassadours of the princes of Babel, which sent vnto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the lande, God left him to trie him, and to knowe all that was in his heart.","32":"Concerning the rest of the actes of Hezekiah, and his goodnesse, beholde, they are written in the vision of Ishiah the Prophet, the sonne of Amoz, in the booke of the Kings of Iudah and Israel.","33":"So Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buryed him in the highest sepulchre of the sonnes of Dauid: and all Iudah and the inhabitants of Ierusalem did him honour at his death: and Manasseh his sonne reigned in his stead."}
