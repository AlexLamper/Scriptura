{"1":"So Abiiah slept with his fathers, and they buryed him in the citie of Dauid, and Asa his sonne reigned in his steade: in whose dayes the lande was quiet ten yeere.","2":"And Asa did that was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God.","3":"For he tooke away the altars of the strange gods and the hie places, and brake downe the images, and cut downe the groues,","4":"And commanded Iudah to seeke the Lord God of their fathers, and to doe according to the Lawe and the comandement.","5":"And he tooke away out of all the cities of Iudah the hie places, and the images: therefore the kingdome was quiet before him.","6":"He built also strong cities in Iudah, because the lande was in rest, and he had no warre in those yeeres: for the Lord had giuen him rest.","7":"Therefore he saide to Iudah, Let vs builde these cities and make walles about, and towers, gates, and barres, whiles the lande is before vs: because we haue sought the Lorde our God, we haue sought him, and he hath giuen vs rest on euery side: so they built and prospered.","8":"And Asa had an armie of Iudah that bare shieldes and speares, three hundreth thousande, and of Beniamin that bare shieldes and drewe bowes, two hundreth and foure score thousande: all these were valiant men.","9":"And there came out against them Zerah of Ethiopia with an hoste of ten hundreth thousande, and three hundreth charets, and came vnto Mareshah.","10":"Then Asa went out before him, and they set the battell in aray in the valley of Zephathah beside Mareshah.","11":"And Asa cryed vnto the Lorde his God, and saide, Lord, it is nothing with thee to helpe with many, or with no power: helpe vs, O Lorde our God: for we rest on thee, and in thy Name are we come against this multitude: O Lorde, thou art our God, let not man preuaile against thee.","12":"So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Iudah, and the Ethiopians fled.","13":"And Asa and the people that was with him, pursued them vnto Gerar; the Ethiopians hoste was ouerthrowen, so that there was no life in them: for they were destroyed before the Lorde and before his hoste: and they caryed away a mightie great spoyle.","14":"And they smote all the cities rounde about Gerar: for the feare of the Lorde came vpon them, and they spoyled all the cities, for there was exceeding much spoyle in them.","15":"Yea, and they smote the tents of cattel, and carried away plentie of sheepe and camels, and returned to Ierusalem."}
