{"1":"Then King Salomon assembled the Elders of Israel, euen all the heads of the tribes, the chiefe fathers of the children of Israel vnto him in Ierusalem, for to bring vp the Arke of the couenant of the Lorde from the citie of Dauid, which is Zion.","2":"And all the men of Israel assembled vnto King Salomon at the feast in the moneth of Ethanim, which is the seuenth moneth.","3":"And all the Elders of Israel came and the Priests tooke the Arke.","4":"They bare the Arke of the Lorde, and they bare the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle: those did the Priestes and Leuites bring vp.","5":"And King Salomon and all the Congregation of Israel, that were assembled vnto him, were with him before the Arke, offering sheepe and beeues, which could not be tolde, nor nombred for multitude.","6":"So the Priestes brought the Arke of the couenant of the Lorde vnto his place, into the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, euen vnder the wings of the Cherubims.","7":"For ye Cherubims stretched out their wings ouer the place of the Arke, and the Cherubims couered the Arke, and the barres thereof aboue.","8":"And they drewe out the barres, that the endes of the barres might appeare out of the Sanctuarie before the oracle, but they were not seene without: and there they are vnto this day.","9":"Nothing was in the Arke saue the two tables of stone which Moses had put there at Horeb, where the Lorde made a couenant with the children of Israel, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.","10":"And when the Priestes were come out of the Sanctuarie, the cloude filled the house of the Lorde,","11":"So that the Priestes could not stande to minister, because of the cloude: for the glorie of the Lorde had filled the house of the Lorde.","12":"Then spake Salomon, The Lord said, that he woulde dwell in the darke cloude.","13":"I haue built thee an house to dwell in, an habitation for thee to abide in for euer.","14":"And the King turned his face, and blessed all the Congregation of Israel: for all the Congregation of Israel stoode there.","15":"And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spake with his mouth vnto Dauid my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,","16":"Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no citie of all the tribes of Israel, to builde an house that my name might be there: but I haue chosen Dauid to be ouer my people Israel.","17":"And it was in ye heart of Dauid my father to builde an house to the Name of the Lorde God of Israel.","18":"And the Lord said vnto Dauid my father, Where as it was in thine heart to build an house vnto my Name, thou diddest well, that thou wast so minded:","19":"Neuerthelesse thou shalt not builde the house, but thy sonne that shall come out of thy loynes, he shall builde the house vnto my Name.","20":"And the Lorde hath made good his worde that he spake: and I am risen vp in the roume of Dauid my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and haue built the house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel.","21":"And I haue prepared therein a place for the Arke, wherein is the couenant of the Lorde which he made with our fathers, whe he brought them out of the lande of Egypt.","22":"Then Salomon stoode before the altar of the Lorde in the sight of all the Congregation of Israel, and stretched out his handes towarde heauen,","23":"And sayd, O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, thou that keepest couenant and mercie with thy seruants that walke before thee with all their heart,","24":"Thou that hast kept with thy seruant Dauid my father, that thou hast promised him: for thou spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hande, as appeareth this day.","25":"Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keepe with thy seruant Dauid my father that thou hast promised him, saying, Thou shalt not want a man in my sight to sit vpon ye throne of Israel: so that thy childre take heed to their way, that they walke before me; as thou hast walked in my sight","26":"And nowe, O God of Israel, I pray thee, let thy worde be verified, which thou spakest vnto thy seruant Dauid my father.","27":"Is it true in deede that God will dwell on the earth? beholde, the heauens, and the heauens of heauens are not able to conteine thee: howe much more vnable is this house that I haue built?","28":"But haue thou respect vnto the prayer of thy seruant, and to his supplication, O Lorde, my God, to heare the cry and prayer which thy seruant prayeth before thee this day:","29":"That thine eyes may be open toward this house, night and day, euen towarde the place whereof thou hast said, My Name shalbe there: that thou mayest hearken vnto the prayer which thy seruant prayeth in this place.","30":"Heare thou therefore the supplication of thy seruant, and of thy people Israel, which pray in this place, & heare thou in the place of thine habitation, euen in heauen, and when thou hearest, haue mercie.","31":"When a man shall trespasse against his neighbour, & he lay vpon him an othe to cause him to sweare, and the swearer shall come before thine altar in this house,","32":"Then heare thou in heauen, and doe and iudge thy seruants, that thou condemne the wicked to bring his way vpon his head, and iustifie the righteous, to giue him according to his righteousnesse.","33":"When thy people Israel shall be ouerthrowen before the enemie, because they haue sinned against thee, and turne againe to thee, and confesse thy Name, and pray and make supplication vnto thee in this house,","34":"Then heare thou in heauen, and be mercifull vnto the sinne of thy people Israel, and bring them againe vnto the lande, which thou gauest vnto their fathers.","35":"When heauen shalbe shut vp, & there shalbe no raine because they haue sinned against thee, and shall pray in this place, and confesse thy Name, and turne from their sinne, when thou doest afflict them,","36":"Then heare thou in heauen, and pardon the sinne of thy seruants and of thy people Israel (when thou hast taught the the good way wherein they may walke) and giue raine vpon the land that thou hast giuen to thy people to inherite.","37":"When there shalbe famine in the land, when there shalbe pestilence, when there shall be blasting, mildewe, grashopper or caterpiller, when their enemie shall besiege them in the cities of their lande, or any plague, or any sickenesse,","38":"Then what prayer, and supplication so euer shalbe made of any man or of all thy people Israel, when euery one shall knowe the plague in his owne heart, and stretch foorth his handes in this house,","39":"Heare thou then in heauen, in thy dwelling place, and be mercifull, and doe, and giue euery man according to all his wayes, as thou knowest his heart, (for thou only knowest the heartes of all the children of men)","40":"That they may feare thee as long as they liue in ye lad, which thou gauest vnto our fathers.","41":"Moreouer as touching the stranger that is not of thy people Israel, who shall come out of a farre countrey for thy Names sake,","42":"(When they shal heare of thy great name, and of thy mightie hande, and of thy stretched out arme) and shall come and pray in this house,","43":"Heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth for vnto thee: that all the people of the earth may know thy Name, and feare thee, as do thy people Israel: and that they may know, that thy Name is called vpon in this house which I haue built.","44":"When thy people shall go out to battell against their enemie by the way that thou shalt sende them, and shall pray vnto the Lorde towarde the way of the citie which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I haue built for thy Name,","45":"Heare thou then in heauen their prayer & their supplication, and iudge their cause.","46":"If they sinne against thee, ( for there is no man that sinneth not) and thou be angry with them, and deliuer them vnto the enemies, so that they cary them away prisoners vnto the land of the enemies, either farre or neere,","47":"Yet if they turne againe vnto their heart in the lande (to the which they be caryed away captiues) and returne and pray vnto thee in the lande of them that caryed them away captiues, saying, We haue sinned, we haue transgressed, and done wickedly,","48":"If they turne againe vnto thee with all their heart, and with all their soule in the lande of their enemies, which led them away captiues, and pray vnto thee toward the way of their land, which thou gauest vnto their fathers, and toward the citie which thou hast chosen, and the house, which I haue built for thy Name,","49":"Then heare thou their prayer and their supplication in heauen thy dwelling place, and iudge their cause,","50":"And be mercifull vnto thy people that haue sinned against thee, and vnto all their iniquities (wherein they haue transgressed against thee) and cause that they, which led them away captiues, may haue pitie and compassion on them:","51":"For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out of Egypt from the middes of the yron fornace.","52":"Let thine eyes be open vnto the prayer of thy seruant, and vnto the prayer of thy people Israel, to hearken vnto them, in all that they call for vnto thee.","53":"For thou diddest separate them to thee from among all people of the earth for an inheritance, as thou saidest by the hand of Moses thy seruant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.","54":"And when Salomon had made an ende of praying all this prayer and supplication vnto the Lorde, he arose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling on his knees, and stretching of his handes to heauen,","55":"And stoode and blessed all the Congregation of Israel with a loud voyce, saying,","56":"Blessed be the Lorde that hath giuen rest vnto his people Israel, according to all that hee promised: there hath not fayled one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of Moses his seruant.","57":"The Lorde our God be with vs, as he was with our fathers, that he forsake vs not, neither leaue vs,","58":"That he may bow our heartes vnto him, that we may walke in all his waies, and keepe his commandements, and his statutes, and his lawes, which he commanded our fathers.","59":"And these my wordes, which I haue prayed before the Lorde, be neere vnto the Lorde our God day and night, that he defende the cause of his seruant, and the cause of his people Israel alway as the matter requireth,","60":"That all the people of ye earth may knowe, that the Lord is God, and none other.","61":"Let your heart therefore be perfit with the Lorde our God to walke in his statutes, and to keepe his commandements, as this day.","62":"Then the King and all Israel with him offred sacrifice before the Lorde.","63":"And Salomon offered a sacrifice of peace offrings which he offered vnto the Lorde, to wit, two and twentie thousande beeues, and an hundreth and twentie thousande sheepe: so the king & all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lorde.","64":"The same day did the King halowe the middle of the court, that was before the house of the Lorde: for there he made burnt offerings, and the meate offrings, and the fat of the peace offeringes, because the brasen altar that was before the Lorde, was too litle to receiue the burnt offerings, and the meate offerings, and the fat of the peace offrings.","65":"And Salomon made at that time a feast & all Israel with him, a very great Congregation, euen from the entring in of Hamath vnto the riuer of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seuen dayes and seuen dayes, euen fourteene dayes.","66":"And the eight day he sent the people away: and they thanked the King and went vnto their tentes ioyous and with glad heart, because of al the goodnesse that the Lord had done for Dauid his seruant, and for Israel his people."}
