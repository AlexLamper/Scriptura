And hee was a very goodly man, and his mother bare him next after Absalom.","7":"And he tooke counsel of Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, and of Abiathar the Priest: and they helped forward Adoniiah.","8":"But Zadok the Priest, & Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and Nathan the Prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the men of might, which were with Dauid, were not with Adoniiah.","9":"Then Adoniiah sacrificed sheepe and oxen, and fat cattel by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the kings sonnes, & al the men of Iudah ye Kings seruants,","10":"But Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah, and the mightie men, and Salomon his brother hee called not.","11":"Wherefore Nathan spake vnto Bath-sheba the mother of Salomon, saying, Hast thou not heard, that Adoniiah ye sonne of Haggith doeth reigne, and Dauid our lord knoweth it not?","12":"Now therefore come, and I will now giue thee counsell, howe to saue thine owne life, and the life of thy sonne Salomon.","13":"Go, and get thee in vnto King Dauid, and say vnto him, Didest not thou, my lorde, O King, sweare vnto thine handmaide, saying, Assuredly Salomo thy sonne shall reigne after me, & he shal sit vpon my throne? why is then Adoniiah King?","14":"Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the King, I also will come in after thee, and confirme thy wordes.","15":"So Bath-sheba went in vnto the King into the chamber, and the King was verie olde, and Abishag the Shunammite ministred vnto ye King.","16":"And Bath-sheba bowed and made obeisance vnto the King;
