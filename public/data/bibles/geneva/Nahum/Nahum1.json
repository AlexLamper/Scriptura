{"1":"The burden of Nineueh. The booke of the vision of Nahum the Elkeshite.","2":"God is ielous, & the Lord reuengeth: the Lord reuengeth: euen the Lorde of anger, the Lorde will take vengeance on his aduersaries, & he reserueth wrath for his enemies.","3":"The Lord is slow to anger, but he is great in power, and will not surely cleare the wicked: the Lord hath his way in ye whirlewind, & in the storme, and the cloudes are the dust of his feete.","4":"He rebuketh the sea, and dryeth it, and he dryeth vp all the riuers: Bashan is wasted and Carmel, and the floure of Lebanon is wasted.","5":"The mountaines tremble for him, and the hilles melt, & the earth is burnt at his sight, yea, the worlde, and all that dwell therein.","6":"Who can stande before his wrath? Or who can abide in the fiercenesse of his wrath? His wrath is powred out like fire, and the rockes are broken by him.","7":"The Lorde is good and as a strong hold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth them that trust in him.","8":"But passing ouer as with a flood, he will vtterly destroy the place thereof, and darknesse shall pursue his enemies.","9":"What doe ye imagine against the Lord? He wil make an vtter destruction: affliction shal not rise vp the seconde time.","10":"For he shall come as vnto thornes folden one in another, and as vnto drunkardes in their drunkennesse: they shall be deuoured as stubble fully dryed.","11":"There commeth one out of thee that imagineth euill against the Lorde, euen a wicked counsellour.","12":"Thus saith the Lorde, Though they be quiet, and also many, yet thus shall they be cut off when he shall passe by: though I haue afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.","13":"For nowe I will breake his yoke from thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.","14":"And the Lorde hath giuen a commandement concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sowen: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the grauen, and the molten image: I will make it thy graue for thee, for thou art vile.","15":"Beholde vpon the mountaines the feete of him that declareth, and publisheth peace: O Iudah, keepe thy solemne feastes, perfourme thy vowes: for the wicked shall no more passe thorowe thee: he is vtterly cut off."}
