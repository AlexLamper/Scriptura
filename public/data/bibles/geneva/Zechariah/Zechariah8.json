{"1":"Againe the worde of the Lord of hostes came to me, saying,","2":"Thus saith the Lord of hostes, I was ielous for Zion with great ielousie, and I was ielous for her with great wrath.","3":"Thus saith the Lord, I wil returne vnto Zion, & wil dwel in the mids of Ierusalem: & Ierusalem shalbe called a citie of trueth, & the Mountaine of the Lord of hostes, the holy Mountaine.","4":"Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, There shall yet olde men and olde women dwell in the streetes of Ierusalem, & euery man with his staffe in his hand for very age.","5":"And the streetes of the citie shalbe full of boyes and girles, playing in the streetes thereof.","6":"Thus saith the Lord of hostes, Though it be vnpossible in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these dayes, should it therefore be vnpossible in my sight, sayth the Lord of hostes?","7":"Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, Beholde, I will deliuer my people from the East countrey, and from the West countrey.","8":"And I wil bring them, & they shal dwel in the mids of Ierusalem, & they shalbe my people, & I wil be their God in trueth, & in righteousnes.","9":"Thus sayth the Lorde of hostes, Let your hands be strong, ye that heare in these dayes these words by the mouth of the Prophets, which were in the day, that the foundation of the House of the Lord of hostes was laide, that the Temple might be builded.","10":"For before these dayes there was no hire for man nor any hire for beast, neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men, euery one against his neighbour.","11":"But nowe, I wil not intreate the residue of this people as aforetime, saith the Lord of hostes.","12":"For the seede shall be prosperous: the vine shall giue her fruite, and the ground shal giue her increase, and the heauens shall giue their dewe, and I will cause the remnant of this people to possesse all these things.","13":"And it shal come to passe, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Iudah, and house of Israel, so wil I deliuer you, & ye shalbe a blessing: feare not, but let your hands be strong.","14":"For thus sayth the Lorde of hostes, As I thought to punish you, when your fathers prouoked me vnto wrath, sayth the Lord of hostes, and repented not,","15":"So againe haue I determined in these daies to doe well vnto Ierusalem, and to the house of Iudah: feare ye not.","16":"These are ye things that ye shall doe. Speake ye euery man the trueth vnto his neighbour: execute iudgement truly & vprightly in your gates,","17":"And let none of you imagine euill in your hearts against his neighbour, and loue no false othe: for all these are the things that I hate, saith the Lorde.","18":"And the worde of the Lord of hostes came vnto me, saying,","19":"Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, The fast of the fourth moneth, and the fast of the fift, and the fast of the seuenth, & the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Iudah ioy & gladnes, & prosperous hie feasts: therefore loue the trueth & peace.","20":"Thus saith the Lord of hostes, That there shall yet come people, and the inhabitants of great cities.","21":"And they that dwell in one citie, shal go to another, saying, Vp, let vs go & pray before the Lord, and seeke the Lord of hostes: I wil go also.","22":"Yea, great people and mightie nations shal come to seeke the Lorde of hostes in Ierusalem, and to pray before the Lord.","23":"Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, In those dayes shall ten men take holde out of all languages of the nations, euen take holde of the skirt of him that is a Iewe, and say, We will go with you: for we haue heard that God is with you."}
