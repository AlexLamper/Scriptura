{"1":"In that day there shall be a fountaine opened to the house of Dauid, and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem, for sinne and for vncleannesse.","2":"And in that day, sayth the Lord of hostes, I will cut off the names of the idoles out of the land: and they shall no more be remembred: and I will cause the prophets, and the vncleane spirit to depart out of the land.","3":"And when any shall yet prophesie, his father and his mother that begate him, shall say vnto him, Thou shalt not liue: for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lorde: and his father and his mother that begat him, shal thrust him through, when he prophesieth.","4":"And in that day shall the prophetes be ashamed euery one of his vision, when he hath prophesied: neither shall they weare a rough garment to deceiue.","5":"But he shall say, I am no Prophet: I am an husbandman: for man taught me to be an heardman from my youth vp.","6":"And one shal say vnto him, What are these woundes in thine hands? Then he shall answere, Thus was I wounded in the house of my friendes.","7":"Arise, O sword, vpon my shepheard, and vpon the man, that is my fellow, sayth the Lord of hostes: smite the shepheard, and the sheepe shall be scattered: and I will turne mine hand vpon the litle ones.","8":"And in all the land, sayeth the Lord, two partes therein shall be cut off, and die: but the third shall be left therein.","9":"And I will bring that third part thorowe the fire, and will fine them as the siluer is fined, and will trye them as golde is tryed: they shall call on my Name, and I will heare them: I will say, It is my people, and they shall say, The Lorde is my God."}
