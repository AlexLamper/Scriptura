{"1":"I lift vp mine eyes againe and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.","2":"Then saide I, Whither goest thou? And he saide vnto me, To measure Ierusalem, that I may see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.","3":"And beholde, the Angel that talked with me, went foorth: and another Angel went out to meete him,","4":"And saide vnto him, Runne, speake to this yong man, and say, Ierusalem shalbe inhabited without walles, for the multitude of men and cattell therein.","5":"For I, saith the Lord, will be vnto her a wall of fire round about, and wil be the glory in the middes of her.","6":"Ho, ho, come forth, & flee from the land of the North, saith the Lord: for I haue scattered you into the foure winds of the heauen, saith ye Lord.","7":"Saue thy selfe, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babel.","8":"For thus saith the Lord of hostes, After this glory hath hee sent me vnto the nations, which spoyled you: for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.","9":"For beholde, I will lift vp mine hand vpon them: and they shalbe a spoyle to those that serued them, and ye shall knowe, that the Lord of hostes hath sent me.","10":"Reioyce, and be glad, O daughter Zion: for loe, I come, and will dwell in the middes of thee, saith the Lord.","11":"And many nations shall be ioyned to the Lord in that day, and shalbe my people: and I will dwell in the middes of thee, and thou shalt knowe that the Lord of hostes hath sent me vnto thee.","12":"And the Lord shall inherite Iudah his portion in the holy lande, and shall chuse Ierusalem againe.","13":"Let all flesh be still before the Lord: for he is raised vp out of his holy place."}
