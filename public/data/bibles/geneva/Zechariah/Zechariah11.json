{"1":"Open thy doores, O Lebanon, and the fire shall deuoure thy cedars.","2":"Houle, firre trees: for the cedar is fallen, because all the mightie are destroyed: houle ye, O okes of Bashan, for ye defesed forest is cut downe.","3":"There is the voyce of the houling of the shepherdes: for their glorie is destroyed: the voyce of ye roaring of lyons whelpes: for the pride of Iorden is destroyed.","4":"Thus sayeth the Lorde my God, Feede the sheepe of the slaughter.","5":"They that possesse them, slay them and sinne not: and they that sell them, say, Blessed be the Lord: for I am riche, and their owne shepherds spare them not.","6":"Surely I wil no more spare those that dwell in the land, sayth the Lord: but loe, I will deliuer the men euery one into his neighbours hand, and into the hand of his King: and they shal smite the land, and out of their hands I wil not deliuer them.","7":"For I fed the sheepe of slaughter, euen the poore of the flocke, and I tooke vnto me two staues: the one I called Beautie, and the other I called Bandes, and I fed the sheepe.","8":"Three shepherdes also I cut off in one moneth, and my soule lothed them, and their soule abhorred me.","9":"Then said I, I will not feede you: that that dyeth, let it dye: and that that perisheth, let it perish: and let the remnant eate, euery one the flesh of his neighbour.","10":"And I tooke my staffe, euen Beautie, and brake it, that I might disanull my couenant, which I had made with all people.","11":"And it was broken in that day: and so the poore of the sheepe that waited vpon me, knew that it was the worde of the Lord.","12":"And I said vnto them, If ye thinke it good, giue me my wages: and if no, leaue off: so they weighed for my wages thirtie pieces of siluer.","13":"And the Lord said vnto me, Cast it vnto the potter: a goodly price, that I was valued at of them; I tooke the thirtie pieces of siluer, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.","14":"Then brake I mine other staffe, euen the Bandes, that I might dissolue the brotherhood betweene Iudah and Israel.","15":"And the Lord said vnto me, Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepheard.","16":"For loe, I will rayse vp a shepheard in the land, which shall not looke for the thing, that is lost, nor seeke the tender lambes, nor heale that that is hurt, nor feede that that standeth vp: but he shall eate the flesh of the fat, and teare their clawes in pieces.","17":"O idole shepheard that leaueth the flocke: the sword shalbe vpon his arme, & vpon his right eye. His arme shall be cleane dryed vp, and his right eye shall be vtterly darkened."}
