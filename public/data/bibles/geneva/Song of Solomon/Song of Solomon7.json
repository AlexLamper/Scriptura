{"1":"Howe beautifull are thy goings with shooes, O princes daughter! the ioynts of thy thighs are like iewels: the worke of the hande of a cunning workeman.","2":"Thy nauel is as a round cuppe that wanteth not licour: thy belly is as an heape of wheat compassed about with lilies.","3":"Thy two breastes are as two young roes that are twinnes.","4":"Thy necke is like a towre of yuorie: thine eyes are like the fishe pooles in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the towre of Lebanon, that looketh toward Damascus.","5":"Thine head vpon thee is as skarlet, and the bush of thine head like purple: the King is tyed in the rafters.","6":"Howe faire art thou, and howe pleasant art thou, O my loue, in pleasures!","7":"This thy stature is like a palme tree, and thy brestes like clusters.","8":"I saide, I will goe vp into the palme tree, I will take holde of her boughes: thy breastes shall nowe be like the clusters of the vine: and the sauour of thy nose like apples,","9":"And the roufe of thy mouth like good wine, which goeth straight to my welbeloued, and causeth the lippes of the ancient to speake.","10":"I am my welbeloueds, and his desire is toward mee.","11":"Come, my welbeloued, let vs go foorth into the fielde: let vs remaine in the villages.","12":"Let vs get vp early to the vines, let vs see if the vine florish, whether it hath budded the small grape, or whether the pomegranates florish: there will I giue thee my loue.","13":"The mandrakes haue giuen a smell, and in our gates are all sweete things, new and olde: my welbeloued, I haue kept them for thee."}
