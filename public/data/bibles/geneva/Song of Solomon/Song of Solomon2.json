{"1":"I am the rose of the fielde, and the lilie of the valleys.","2":"Like a lilie amog the thornes, so is my loue among the daughters.","3":"Like the apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my welbeloued among the sonnes of men: vnder his shadow had I delite, & sate downe: and his fruite was sweete vnto my mouth.","4":"Hee brought mee into the wine cellar, and loue was his banner ouer me.","5":"Stay me with flagons, and comfort me with apples: for I am sicke of loue.","6":"His left hande is vnder mine head, and his right hand doeth imbrace me.","7":"I charge you, O daughters of Ierusalem, by the roes and by the hindes of the fielde, that ye stirre not vp, nor waken my loue, vntill she please.","8":"It is the voyce of my welbeloued: beholde, hee commeth leaping by the mountaines, and skipping by the hilles.","9":"My welbeloued is like a roe, or a yong hart: loe, he standeth behinde our wall, looking forth of the windowes, shewing him selfe through the grates.","10":"My welbeloued spake and said vnto me, Arise, my loue, my faire one, and come thy way.","11":"For beholde, winter is past: the raine is changed, and is gone away.","12":"The flowers appeare in the earth: the time of the singing of birdes is come, and the voyce of the turtle is heard in our land.","13":"The figtree hath brought foorth her yong figges: and the vines with their small grapes haue cast a sauour: arise my loue, my faire one, and come away.","14":"My doue, that art in the holes of ye rocke, in the secret places of the staires, shewe mee thy sight, let mee heare thy voyce: for thy voyce is sweete, and thy sight comely.","15":"Take vs the foxes, the little foxes, which destroy the vines: for our vines haue small grapes.","16":"My welbeloued is mine, and I am his: hee feedeth among the lilies,","17":"Vntil the day breake, and the shadowes flee away: returne, my welbeloued, and be like a roe, or a yong hart vpon the mountaines of Bether."}
