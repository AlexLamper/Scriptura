{"1":"I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I gathered my myrrhe with my spice: I ate mine hony combe with mine hony, I dranke my wine with my milke: eate, O friends, drinke, and make you mery, O welbeloued.","2":"I sleepe, but mine heart waketh, it is the voyce of my welbeloued that knocketh, saying, Open vnto mee, my sister, my loue, my doue, my vndefiled: for mine head is full of dewe, and my lockes with the droppes of the night.","3":"I haue put off my coate, howe shall I put it on? I haue washed my feete, howe shall I defile them?","4":"My welbeloued put in his hand by the hole of the doore, and mine heart was affectioned toward him.","5":"I rose vp to open to my welbeloued, and mine hands did drop downe myrrhe, and my fingers pure myrrhe vpon the handels of the barre.","6":"I opened to my welbeloued: but my welbeloued was gone, and past: mine heart was gone when hee did speake: I sought him, but I coulde not finde him: I called him, but hee answered mee not.","7":"The watchmen that went about the citie, founde me: they smote me and wounded me: the watchmen of the walles tooke away my vaile from me.","8":"I charge you, O daughters of Ierusalem, if you finde my welbeloued, that you tell him that I am sicke of loue.","9":"O the fairest among women, what is thy welbeloued more then other welbeloued? what is thy welbeloued more then another louer, that thou doest so charge vs?","10":"My welbeloued is white and ruddie, the chiefest of ten thousand.","11":"His head is as fine golde, his lockes curled, and blacke as a rauen.","12":"His eyes are like doues vpon the riuers of waters, which are washt with milke, and remaine by the full vessels.","13":"His cheekes are as a bedde of spices, and as sweete flowres, and his lippes like lilies dropping downe pure myrrhe.","14":"His hands as rings of gold set with the chrysolite, his belly like white yuorie couered with saphirs.","15":"His legges are as pillars of marble, set vpon sockets of fine golde: his countenance as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.","16":"His mouth is as sweete thinges, and hee is wholy delectable: this is my welbeloued, and this is my louer, O daughters of Ierusalem."}
