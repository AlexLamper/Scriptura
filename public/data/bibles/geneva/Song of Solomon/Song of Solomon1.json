{"1":"An excellent song which was Salomons.","2":"Let him kisse me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy loue is better then wine.","3":"Because of the sauour of thy good ointments thy name is as an ointment powred out: therefore the virgins loue thee.","4":"Drawe me: we will runne after thee: the King hath brought me into his chabers: we will reioyce and be glad in thee: we will remember thy loue more then wine: the righteous do loue thee.","5":"I am blacke, O daughters of Ierusalem, but comely, as the tentes of Kedar, and as the curtaines of Salomon.","6":"Regard ye me not because I am blacke: for the sunne hath looked vpon mee. The sonnes of my mother were angry against mee: they made me the keeper of ye vines: but I kept not mine owne vine.","7":"Shewe me, O thou, whome my soule loueth, where thou feedest, where thou liest at noone: for why should I be as she that turneth aside to the flockes of thy companions?","8":"If thou knowe not, O thou the fairest among women, get thee foorth by the steps of the flocke, and feede thy kiddes by the tents of the shepheards.","9":"I haue compared thee, O my loue, to the troupe of horses in the charets of Pharaoh.","10":"Thy cheekes are comely with rowes of stones, and thy necke with chaines.","11":"We will make thee borders of golde with studdes of siluer.","12":"Whiles the King was at his repast, my spikenard gaue the smell thereof.","13":"My welbeloued is as a bundle of myrrhe vnto me: he shall lie betweene my breasts.","14":"My welbeloued is as a cluster of camphire vnto me in the vines of Engedi.","15":"My loue, beholde, thou art faire: beholde, thou art faire: thine eyes are like the doues.","16":"My welbeloued, beholde, thou art faire and pleasant: also our bed is greene:","17":"The beames of our house are cedars, our rafters are of firre."}
