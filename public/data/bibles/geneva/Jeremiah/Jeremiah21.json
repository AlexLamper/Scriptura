{"1":"The worde which came vnto Ieremiah from the Lord, when king Zedekiah sent vnto him Pashur, the sonne of Malchiah, and Zephaniah, the sonne of Maaseiah the Priest, saying,","2":"Inquire, I pray thee, of the Lorde for vs, (for Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel maketh warre against vs) if so be that the Lord will deale with vs according to all his wonderous workes, that he may returne vp from vs.","3":"Then said Ieremiah, Thus shall you say to Zedekiah,","4":"Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I will turne backe the weapons of warre that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the King of Babel, and against the Caldeans, which besiege you without the walles, and I will assemble them into the middes of this citie.","5":"And I my selfe will fight against you with an outstretched hand, & with a mighty arme, eue in anger and in wrath, and in great indignation.","6":"And I will smite the inhabitants of this citie, both man, and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.","7":"And after this, sayeth the Lorde, I will deliuer Zedekiah the King of Iudah, and his seruants, and the people, and such as are left in this citie, from the pestilence, from the sworde and from the famine into the hande of Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel, and into the hande of their enemies, and into the hande of those that seeke their liues, and he shall smite them with the edge of the sworde: he shall not spare them, neither haue pitie nor compassion.","8":"And vnto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lorde, Beholde, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.","9":"He that abideth in this citie, shall dye by the sword and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Caldeans, that besiege you, he shall liue, and his life shalbe vnto him for a pray.","10":"For I haue set my face against this citie, for euill and not for good, saith the Lorde: it shalbe giuen into the hande of the King of Babel, and he shall burne it with fire.","11":"And say vnto the house of the King of Iudah, Heare ye the worde of the Lorde.","12":"O house of Dauid, thus saith the Lorde, Execute iudgement in the morning, and deliuer the oppressed out of the hande of the oppressor, lest my wrath go out like fire and burne, that none can quench it, because of the wickednes of your workes.","13":"Beholde, I come against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, & rocke of the plaine, saith the Lord, which say, Who shall come downe against vs? or who shall enter into our habitations?","14":"But I wil visite you according to the fruite of your workes, saith the Lord, and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall deuoure rounde about it."}
