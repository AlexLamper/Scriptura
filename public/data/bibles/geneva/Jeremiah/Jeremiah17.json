{"1":"The sinne of Iudah is written with a pen of yron, and with the poynt of a diamonde, and grauen vpon the table of their heart, and vpon the hornes of your altars.","2":"They remember their altars as their children, with their groues by the greene trees vpon the hilles.","3":"O my mountaine in the fielde, I will giue thy substance, and all thy treasures to be spoyled, for the sinne of thy high places throughout all thy borders.","4":"And thou shalt rest, and in thee shall be a rest from thine heritage that I gaue thee, and I will cause thee to serue thine enemies in the land, which thou knowest not: for yee haue kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burne for euer.","5":"Thus saith the Lord, Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arme, and withdraweth his heart from the Lord.","6":"For he shall be like the heath in the wildernesse, and shall not see when any good commeth, but shall inhabite the parched places in the wildernesse, in a salt land, and not inhabited.","7":"Blessed be the man, that trusteth in ye Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.","8":"For he shall be as a tree that is planted by the water, which spreadeth out her rootes by the riuer, and shall not feele when the heate commeth, but her leafe shall be greene, and shall not care for the yeere of drought, neyther shall cease from yeelding fruit.","9":"The heart is deceitfull and wicked aboue all things, who can knowe it?","10":"I the Lord search the heart, and try ye reines, euen to giue euery man according to his wayes, and according to the fruite of his workes.","11":"As the partryche gathereth the yong, which she hath not brought forth: so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leaue them in the middes of his dayes, and at his ende shall bee a foole.","12":"As a glorious throne exalted fro the beginning, so is the place of our Sanctuarie.","13":"O Lorde, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee, shall be confounded: they that depart from thee, shalbe written in the earth, because they haue forsaken the Lord, the fountaine of liuing waters.","14":"Heale me, O Lorde, and I shall bee whole: saue me, and I shall bee saued: for thou art my prayse.","15":"Behold, they say vnto me, Where is the word of the Lord? let it come nowe.","16":"But I haue not thrust in my selfe for a pastour after thee, neither haue I desired the day of miserie, thou knowest: that which came out of my lips, was right before thee.","17":"Be not terrible vnto mee: thou art mine hope in the day of aduersitie.","18":"Let them bee confounded, that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be afraide, but let not me be afraide: bring vpon them the day of aduersitie, and destroy them with double destruction.","19":"Thus hath the Lord said vnto me, Goe and stande in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the Kings of Iudah come in, and by the which they goe out, & in all ye gates of Ierusalem,","20":"And say vnto them, Heare the word of the Lord, ye Kings of Iudah, and al Iudah, and all the inhabitants of Ierusale, that enter in by these gates.","21":"Thus sayth the Lorde, Take heede to your soules, and beare no burden in the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Ierusalem.","22":"Neither cary foorth burdens out of your houses in the Sabbath day: neither doe yee any worke, but sanctifie the Sabbath, as I commanded your fathers.","23":"But they obeied not, neither inclined their eares, but made their neckes stiffe and would not heare, nor receiue correction.","24":"Neuerthelesse if ye will heare me, sayth the Lorde, and beare no burden through the gates of the citie in the Sabbath day, but sanctifie ye Sabbath day, so that ye do no worke therein,","25":"Then shall the Kings and the princes enter in at the gates of this citie, and shal sit vpon the throne of Dauid, and shall ride vpon charets, and vpon horses, both they and their princes, the men of Iudah, and the inhabitants of Ierusalem: and this citie shall remaine for euer.","26":"And they shall come from the cities of Iudah, and from about Ierusalem, and from the land of Beniamin, and from the plaine, and from the mountaines, and fro the South, which shall bring burnt offrings, and sacrifices, and meate offrings, and incense, and shall bring sacrifice of prayse into the house of the Lord.","27":"But if ye will not heare me to sanctifie the Sabbath day, and not to beare a burden nor to go through the gates of Ierusalem in the Sabbath day, then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall deuoure the palaces of Ierusalem, and it shall not be quenched."}
