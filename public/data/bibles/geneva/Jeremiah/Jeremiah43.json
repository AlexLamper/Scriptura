{"1":"Nowe when Ieremiah had made an ende of speaking vnto ye whole people all the wordes of the Lorde their God, for the which the Lorde their God had sent him to them, euen all these wordes,","2":"Then spake Azariah the sonne of Hoshaiah, and Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the proude men, saying vnto Ieremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the Lorde our God hath not sent thee to say, Goe not into Egypt to dwell there,","3":"But Baruch ye sonne of Neriah prouoketh thee against vs, for to deliuer vs into the hand of the Caldeans, that they might slay vs, and cary vs away captiues into Babel.","4":"So Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the hoste, and all the people obeied not the voyce of the Lorde, to dwell in the lande of Iudah.","5":"But Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the hoste tooke all the remnant of Iudah, that were returned fro al nations, whither they had bene driuen, to dwel in ye land of Iudah:","6":"Euen men and women, and children, and the Kinges daughters, and euery person, that Nebuzar-adan the chiefe steward had left with Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam, ye sonne of Shaphan, and Ieremiah the Prophet, & Baruch the sonne of Neriah.","7":"So they came into the lande of Egypt: for they obeied not the voice of the Lorde: thus came they to Tahpanhes.","8":"Then came the worde of the Lord vnto Ieremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,","9":"Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the claie in the bricke kil, which is at the entrie of Pharaohs house in Tanpanhes in ye sight of the men of Iudah,","10":"And say vnto them, Thus sayeth the Lorde of hostes the God of Israel, Beholde, I will sende and bring Nebuchad-nezzar the King of Babel my seruant, and will set his throne vpon these stones that I haue hid, and he shall spread his pauilion ouer them.","11":"And when he shall come, he shal smite the land of Egypt: such as are appoynted for death, to death, and such as are for captiuitie, to captiuitie, and such as are for the sword to the sword.","12":"And I wil kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burne them and carie them away captiues, and he shall aray himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepheard putteth on his garment, and shall depart from thence in peace.","13":"He shal breake also ye images of Beth-shemesh, that is in the lande of Egypt, and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shal he burne with fire."}
