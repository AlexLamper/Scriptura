{"1":"The Lord then saide vnto Samuel, Howe long wilt thou mourne for Saul, seeing I haue cast him away from reigning ouer Israel? Fill thine horne with oyle and come, I will sende thee to Ishai the Bethlehemite: for I haue prouided mee a King among his sonnes.","2":"And Samuel sayde, Howe can I goe? For if Saul shall heare it, he will kill me. Then the Lorde answered, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to doe sacrifice to the Lord.","3":"And call Ishai to the sacrifice, and I will shewe thee what thou shalt doe, and thou shalt anoynt vnto me him whom I name vnto thee.","4":"So Samuel did that the Lorde bade him, and came to Beth-lehem, and the Elders of the towne were astonied at his coming, and sayd, Commest thou peaceablie?","5":"And he answeared, Yea: I am come to doe sacrifice vnto the Lorde: sanctifie your selues, and come with me to the sacrifice; he sanctified Ishai & his sonnes, & called them to the sacrifice.","6":"And when they were come, hee looked on Eliab, and saide, Surely the Lordes Anointed is before him.","7":"But the Lord said vnto Samuel, Looke not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature, because I haue refused him: for God seeth not as man seeth: for ma looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord beholdeth the heart.","8":"Then Ishai called Abinadab, & made him come before Samuel; he saide, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.","9":"Then Ishai made Shammah come; he said, Neither yet hath the Lorde chosen him.","10":"Againe Ishai made his seue sonnes to come before Samuel: and Samuel saide vnto Ishai, The Lord hath chosen none of these.","11":"Finally, Samuel said vnto Ishai, Are there no more children but these? And hee sayde, There remaineth yet a litle one behinde, that keepeth the sheepe. Then Samuel saide vnto Ishai, Sende and set him: for we will not sit downe, till he be come hither.","12":"And he sent, and brought him in: and he was ruddie, & of a good countenance, and comely visage; the Lorde saide, Arise, and anoynt him: for this is he.","13":"Then Samuel tooke the horne of oyle, and anoynted him in the middes of his brethren; the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Dauid, from that day forwarde: then Samuel rose vp, and went to Ramah.","14":"But the Spirite of the Lorde departed from Saul, and an euill spirite sent of the Lorde vexed him.","15":"And Sauls seruants said vnto him, Beholde nowe, the euill spirite of God vexeth thee.","16":"Let our Lord therefore command thy seruants, that are before thee, to seeke a man that is a cunning plaier vpon the harpe: that when the euil spirit of God commeth vpon thee, hee may play with his hand, and thou maiest be eased.","17":"Saul then saide vnto his seruantes, Prouide me a man, I pray you, that can play well, & bring him to me.","18":"Then answered one of his seruauntes, and sayde, Beholde, I haue seene a sonne of Ishai, a Bethlehemite, that can plaie, and is strong, valiant and a man of warre and wise in matters, and a comely person, and the Lord is with him.","19":"Wherefore Saul sent messengers vnto Ishai, and said, Send me Dauid thy sonne which is with the sheepe.","20":"And Ishai tooke an asse laden with breade and a flagon of wine and a kidde, and sent them by the hand of Dauid his sonne vnto Saul.","21":"And Dauid came to Saul, and stoode before him: and he loued him verie well, and he was his armour bearer.","22":"And Saul sent to Ishai, saying, Let Dauid nowe remaine with me: for he hath found fauour in my sight.","23":"And so when the euil spirite of God came vpon Saul, Dauid tooke an harpe and plaied with his hande, and Saul was refreshed, and was eased: for the euill spirit departed from him."}
