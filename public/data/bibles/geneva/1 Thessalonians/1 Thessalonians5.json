{"1":"Bvt of the times and seasons, brethren, yee haue no neede that I write vnto you.","2":"For ye your selues knowe perfectly, that the day of the Lorde shall come, euen as a thiefe in the night.","3":"For when they shall say, Peace, and safetie, then shall come vpon them sudden destruction, as the trauaile vpon a woman with childe, and they shall not escape,","4":"But ye, brethren, are not in darkenes, that that day shal come on you, as it were a thiefe.","5":"Yee are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, neither of darkenesse.","6":"Therefore let vs not sleepe as do other, but let vs watch and be sober.","7":"For they that sleepe, sleepe in the night, and they that be drunken, are drunken in the night.","8":"But let vs which are of the day, be sober, putting on the brest plate of faith and loue, and of the hope of saluation for an helmet.","9":"For God hath not appointed vs vnto wrath, but to obtaine saluation by the meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ,","10":"Which died for vs, that whether we wake or sleepe, we should liue together with him.","11":"Wherefore exhort one another, and edifie one another, euen as ye doe.","12":"Nowe we beseeche you, brethren, that ye acknowledge them, which labour among you, and are ouer you in the Lorde, & admonish you,","13":"That yee haue them in singular loue for their workes sake. Bee at peace among your selues.","14":"We desire you, brethren, admonish them that are out of order: comfort ye feeble minded: beare with the weake: be pacient toward all men.","15":"See that none recompense euil for euil vnto any man: but euer folow that which is good, both toward your selues, and toward all men.","16":"Reioyce euermore.","17":"Pray continually.","18":"In all thinges giue thankes: for this is the will of God in Christ Iesus toward you.","19":"Quench not the Spirit.","20":"Despise not prophecying.","21":"Try all things, & keepe that which is good.","22":"Absteine from all appearance of euill.","23":"Nowe the very God of peace sanctifie you throughout: and I pray God that your whole spirite and soule and body, may be kept blamelesse vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ.","24":"Faithfull is hee which calleth you, which will also doe it.","25":"Brethren, pray for vs.","26":"Greete all the brethren with an holy kisse.","27":"I charge you in the Lorde, that this Epistle be read vnto all the brethren the Saintes.","28":"The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you, Amen. The first Epistle vnto the Thessalonians written from Athens."}
