{"1":"Blowe the trumpet in Zion, and shoute in mine holy mountaine: let all the inhabitants of the lande tremble: for the day of the Lorde is come: for it is at hand.","2":"A day of darkenesse, and of blacknesse, a day of cloudes, & obscuritie, as the morning spred vpon the mountaines, so is there a great people, and a mighty: there was none like it from the beginning, neither shalbe any more after it, vnto the yeeres of many generations.","3":"A fire deuoureth before him, and behinde him a flame burneth vp: the land is as the garden of Eden before him, & behinde him a desolate wildernesse, so that nothing shal escape him.","4":"The beholding of him is like the sight of horses, & like the horsemen, so shal they runne.","5":"Like the noyse of charrets in the toppes of the mountaines shal they leape, like the noyse of a flame of fire that deuoureth the stubble, and as a mightie people prepared to the battel.","6":"Before his face shal the people tremble: all faces shal gather blackenesse.","7":"They shal runne like strong men, and goe vp to the wall like men of warre, and euery man shall goe forward in his wayes, and they shall not stay in their paths.","8":"Neither shal one thrust another, but euery one shall walke in his path: and when they fall vpon the sword, they shal not be wounded.","9":"They shal runne to & fro in the citie: they shal runne vpon the wall: they shal clime vp vpon the houses, & enter in at ye windowes like ye thiefe.","10":"The earth shal tremble before him, ye heauens shal shake, the sunne & the moone shalbe darke, & the starres shal withdraw their shining,","11":"And the Lord shal vtter his voyce before his hoste: for his hoste is very great: for he is strog that doeth his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible, and who can abide it?","12":"Therefore also now the Lord sayth, Turne you vnto me with all your heart, & with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning,","13":"And rent your heart, & not your clothes: and turne vnto the Lord your God, for he is gratious, and mercifull, slowe to anger, and of great kindnes, and repenteth him of the euill.","14":"Who knoweth, is he wil returne & repent & leaue a blessing behinde him, euen a meate offring, & a drinke offring vnto ye Lord your God?","15":"Blowe the trumpet in Zion, sanctifie a fast, call a solemne assembly.","16":"Gather the people: sanctifie the congregation, gather the elders: assemble the children, & those that sucke the breastes: let the bridegrome go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her bride chamber.","17":"Let the Priestes, the ministers of the Lord weepe betweene the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and giue not thine heritage into reproche that the heathen should rule ouer them. Wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?","18":"Then will the Lorde be ielous ouer his land, and spare his people.","19":"Yea, the Lord wil answere and say vnto his people, Beholde, I will send you corne, and wine, and oyle, and you shalbe satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproche among the heathen,","20":"But I will remooue farre off from you the Northren armie, & I will driue him into a land, barren & desolate with his face toward the East sea, and his end to the vtmost sea, and his stinke shal come vp, and his corruption shal ascend, because he hath exalted himselfe to do this.","21":"Feare not, O land, but be glad, and reioyce: for the Lord wil do great things.","22":"Be not afrayde, ye beastes of the fielde: for the pastures of the wildernesse are greene: for the tree beareth her fruite: the figge tree & the vine do giue their force.","23":"Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and reioyce in the Lorde your God: for he hath giuen you the rayne of righteousnes, he wil cause to come downe for you the rayne, euen the first raine, and the latter raine in the first moneth.","24":"And the barnes shalbe full of wheate, and the presses shal abound with wine and oyle.","25":"And I will render you the yeeres that the grashopper hath eaten, the canker worme and the caterpiller and the palmer worme, my great hoste which I sent among you.","26":"So you shal eate and be satisfied and praise the Name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt marueilously with you: and my people shal neuer be ashamed.","27":"Ye shal also know, that I am in the middes of Israel, and that I am the Lorde your God and none other, & my people shal neuer be ashamed.","28":"And afterward will I powre out my Spirit vpon all flesh: and your sonnes & your daughters shall prophecie: your olde men shall dreame dreames, and your yong men shal see visions,","29":"And also vpon the seruants, and vpon the maydes in those dayes wil I powre my Spirit.","30":"And I will shewe wonders in the heauens & in the earth: blood & fire, & pillars of smoke.","31":"The sunne shalbe turned into darkenesse, and the moone into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.","32":"But whosoeuer shal call on the Name of the Lord, shalbe saued: for in mount Zion, and in Ierusale shalbe deliuerance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant, whom the Lord shal call."}
