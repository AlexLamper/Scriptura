{"1":"(3:31) Nebuchad-nezzar King vnto all people, nations & languages, that dwell in all the world, Peace be multiplied vnto you:","2":"(3:32) I thought it good to declare the signes and wonders, that the hie God hath wrought toward me.","3":"(3:33) How great are his signes, and how mightie are his wonders! his kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome, and his dominion is from generation to generation.","4":"(4:1) I Nebuchad-nezzar being at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace,","5":"(4:2) Saw a dreame, which made me afraide, and the thoughtes vpon my bed, and the visions of mine head troubled me.","6":"(4:3) Therefore made I a decree, that they should bring all the wise men of Babel before mee, that they might declare vnto me the interpretation of the dreame.","7":"(4:4) So came the inchanters, the astrologians, the Caldeans and the sothsayers, to whom I tolde the dreame, but they could not shew me the interpretation thereof,","8":"(4:5) Till at the last Daniel came before mee, (whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, which hath the spirite of the holy gods in him) and before him I tolde the dreame, saying,","9":"(4:6) O Belteshazzar, chiefe of the enchanters, because I know, that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell mee the visions of my dreame, that I haue seene and the interpretation thereof.","10":"(4:7) Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; beholde, I sawe a tree in the middes of the earth and the height thereof was great:","11":"(4:8) A great tree and strong, and the height thereof reached vnto heauen, and the sight thereof to the endes of all the earth.","12":"(4:9) The boughes thereof were faire & the fruite thereof much, and in it was meate for all: it made a shadow vnder it for the beastes of the fielde, and the foules of the heauen dwelt in the boughes thereof, and all flesh fedde of it.","13":"(4:10) I sawe in the visions of mine head vpon my bed, and beholde, a watchman and an holy one came downe from heauen,","14":"(4:11) And cried aloude, and said thus, Hew downe the tree, and breake off his branches: shake off his leaues, and scatter his fruite, that the beastes may flee from vnder it, and the foules from his branches.","15":"(4:12) Neuerthelesse leaue the stumpe of his rootes in the earth, and with a band of yron and brasse binde it among the grasse of the fielde, and let it be wet with the dewe of heauen, and let his portion be with the beastes among the grasse of the fielde.","16":"(4:13) Let his heart be changed from mans nature, and let a beasts heart be giuen vnto him, and let seuen times be passed ouer him.","17":"(4:14) The sentence is according to the decree of the watchmen, and according to the word of the holy ones: the demaunde was answered, to the intent that liuing men may knowe, that the most High hath power ouer the kingdome of men, and giueth it to whomsoeuer he will, and appointeth ouer it the most abiect among men.","18":"(4:15) This is the dreame, that I King Nebuchad-nezzar haue seene: therefore thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof: for all the wisemen of my kingdome are not able to shewe mee the interpretation: but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.","19":"(4:16) Then Daniel (whose name was Belteshazzar) held his peace by the space of one houre, and his thoughts troubled him, & the King spake and said, Belteshazzar, let neither the dreame, nor the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and saide, My lord, the dreame be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.","20":"(4:17) The tree that thou sawest, which was great and mightie, whose height reached vnto the heauen, and the sight thereof through all the world,","21":"(4:18) Whose leaues were faire & the fruit thereof much, and in it was meate for all, vnder the which the beastes of the fielde dwelt, and vpon whose branches the foules of the heauen did sit,","22":"(4:19) It is thou, O King, that art great and mightie: for thy greatnesse is growen, and reacheth vnto heauen, and thy dominion to the endes of the earth.","23":"(4:20) Where as the King sawe a watchman, and an holy one, that came downe from heauen, and said, Hew downe the tree and destroy it, yet leaue the stumpe of the rootes thereof in the earth, and with a bande of yron and brasse binde it among the grasse of the fielde, and let it be wette with the dewe of heauen, and let his portion be with the beastes of the fielde, till seuen times passe ouer him,","24":"(4:21) This is the interpretation, O King, and it is the decree of the most High, which is come vpon my lord the King,","25":"(4:22) That they shall driue thee from men, and thy dwelling shalbe with the beasts of the fielde: they shall make thee to eate grasse as the oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dewe of heauen: and seuen times shall passe ouer thee, till thou knowe, that the most High beareth rule ouer the kingdome of men, and giueth it to whom so euer he will.","26":"(4:23) Where as they sayd, that one should leaue the stumpe of the tree rootes, thy kingdome shall remaine vnto thee: after that, thou shalt knowe, that the heauens haue the rule.","27":"(4:24) Wherefore, O King, let my counsell be acceptable vnto thee, and breake off thy sinnes by righteousnes, and thine iniquities by mercy toward the poore: lo, let there be an healing of thine errour.","28":"(4:25) All these things shal come vpon the King Nebuchad-nezzar.","29":"(4:26) At the end of twelue moneths, he walked in the royall palace of Babel.","30":"(4:27) And the King spake and sayde, Is not this great Babel, that I haue built for the house of the kingdome by the might of my power, and for the honour of my maiestie?","31":"(4:28) While the worde was in the Kings mouth, a voyce came downe from heauen, saying, O King Nebuchad-nezzar, to thee be it spoken, Thy kingdome is departed from thee,","32":"(4:29) And they shall driue thee from men, and thy dwelling shalbe with the beastes of the fielde: they shall make thee to eate grasse, as the oxen, and seuen times shall passe ouer thee, vntill thou knowest, that the most High beareth rule ouer the kingdome of men, and giueth it vnto whomsoeuer he will.","33":"(4:30) The very same houre was this thing fulfilled vpon Nebuchad-nezzar, and hee was driuen from men, and did eate grasse as the oxen, and his body was wet with the dewe of heauen, till his heares were growen as egles feathers, & his nailes like birds clawes.","34":"(4:31) And at the ende of these dayes I Nebuchad-nezzar lift vp mine eyes vnto heauen, and mine vnderstanding was restored vnto me, and I gaue thankes vnto the most High, and I praysed and honoured him that liueth for euer, whose power is an euerlasting power, and his kingdome is from generation to generation.","35":"(4:32) And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and according to his will he worketh in the armie of heauen, and in the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, nor say vnto him, What doest thou?","36":"(4:33) At the same time was mine vnderstanding restored vnto me, and I returned to the honour of my kingdome: my glory and my beautie was restored vnto me, and my counsellours and my princes sought vnto me, and I was established in my kingdome, and my glory was augmented toward me.","37":"(4:34) Now therefore I Nebuchad-nezzar prayse and extoll & magnifie the King of heauen, whose workes are all trueth, & his wayes iudgement, and those that walke in pride, he is able to abase."}
