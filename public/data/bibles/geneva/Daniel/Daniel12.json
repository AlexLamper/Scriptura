{"1":"And at that time shal Michael stand vp, ye great prince, which standeth for ye children of thy people, & there shall be a time of trouble, such as neuer was since there began to be a nation vnto that same time: and at that time thy people shal be deliuered, euery one that shal be foud written in ye boke.","2":"And many of them that sleepe in the dust of the earth, shall awake, some to euerlasting life, and some to shame and perpetuall contempt.","3":"And they that be wise, shal shine, as ye brightnes of the firmament: and they that turne many to righteousnes, shal shine as the starres, for euer & euer.","4":"But thou, O Daniel, shut vp the words, and seale the boke til the end of the time: many shal run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.","5":"Then I Daniel loked, & behold, there stood other two, ye one on this side of ye brinke of ye riuer, & the other on that side of ye brinke of the riuer.","6":"And one saide vnto the man clothed in linen, which was vpon ye waters of the riuer, When shalbe the ende of these wonders?","7":"And I heard ye man clothed in line which was vpon the waters of the riuer, when he helde vp his right hand, & his left hand vnto heauen, & sware by him that liueth for euer, that it shall tarie for a time, two times & an halfe: & when he shal haue accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.","8":"The I heard it, but I vnderstood it not: the said I, O my Lord, what shalbe ye end of these things?","9":"And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for ye words are closed vp, and sealed, till the ende of the time.","10":"Many shalbe purified, made white, & tried: but the wicked shall doe wickedly, and none of the wicked shall haue vnderstanding: but the wise shall vnderstand.","11":"And fro the time that the daily sacrifice shalbe take away & the abominable desolatio set vp, there shalbe a thousand, two hundreth & ninetie daies.","12":"Blessed is he that waiteth & commeth to the thousand, three hundreth & fiue & thirtie daies.","13":"But go thou thy way til ye end be: for thou shalt rest & stand vp in thy lot, at ye end of ye daies."}
