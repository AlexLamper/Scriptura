{"1":"Also I, in ye first yere of Darius of ye Medes, euen I stood to incourage & to strengthen him.","2":"And now wil I shew thee ye trueth, Behold, there shall stand vp yet three Kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be farre richer then they all: and by his strength, and by his riches he shall stirre vp all against the realme of Grecia.","3":"But a mightie King shall stand vp, that shall rule with great dominion, and doe according to his pleasure.","4":"And when he shal stand vp, his kingdome shall be broken, and shall be deuided towarde the foure windes of heauen: and not to his posteritie, nor according to his dominion, which he ruled: for his kingdome shall be pluckt vp, euen to be for others besides those.","5":"And ye King of ye South shalbe mightie, and one of his princes, and shall preuaile against him, & beare rule: his dominio shalbe a great dominion.","6":"And in the ende of yeeres they shalbe ioyned together: for the Kings daughter of ye South shall come to the King of the North to make an agreement, but she shall not reteine the power of the arme, neither shall he continue, nor his arme: but she shall be deliuered to death, and they that brought her, and he that begate her, and he that comforted her in these times.","7":"But out of the bud of her rootes shall one stand vp in his stead, which shall come with an armie, and shall enter into the fortresse of the King of the North, and doe with them as he list, and shall preuaile,","8":"And shall also carie captiues into Egypt their gods with their molten images, and with their precious vessels of siluer and of golde, and he shall continue mo yeeres then the King of the North.","9":"So the King of ye South shall come into his kingdome, and shall returne into his owne land.","10":"Wherefore his sonnes shall be stirred vp, and shall assemble a mightie great armie: and one shall come, and ouerflowe, & passe through: then shall he returne, and be stirred vp at his fortresse.","11":"And the King of the South shall be angrie, and shall come foorth, and fight with him, euen with the King of the North: for he shall set foorth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be giuen into his hand.","12":"Then the multitude shall be proude, and their heart shall be lifted vp: for hee shall cast downe thousands: but he shall not still preuaile.","13":"For the King of the North shall returne, and shall set foorth a greater multitude then afore, and shall come foorth (after certeine yeeres) with a mightie armie, and great riches.","14":"And at the same time there shall many stand vp against the King of the South: also the rebellious children of thy people shal exalt them selues to establish the vision, but they shall fall.","15":"So the King of the North shall come, and cast vp a mount, and take the strong citie: and the armes of the South shall not resist, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.","16":"But he that shall come, shall doe vnto him as he list, and none shall stand against him: and he shal stand in the pleasant land, which by his hand shalbe consumed.","17":"Againe he shall set his face to enter with the power of his whole kingdome, and his confederates with him: thus shal he doe, and he shal giue him the daughter of women, to destroy her: but she shall not stande on his side, neither bee for him.","18":"After this shall he turne his face vnto the yles, and shall take many, but a prince shal cause his shame to light vpon him, beside that he shall cause his owne shame to turne vpon himselfe.","19":"For he shal turne his face toward the fortes of his owne land: but he shall be ouerthrowen and fall, and be no more founde.","20":"Then shal stand vp in his place in the glorie of the kingdome, one that shall raise taxes: but after fewe dayes he shall be destroyed, neither in wrath, nor in battell.","21":"And in his place shall stand vp a vile person, to whom they shall not giue the honour of the kingdome: but he shall come in peaceably, and obteine the kingdome by flatteries.","22":"And the armes shall be ouerthrowen with a flood before him, and shall be broken: and also the prince of the couenant.","23":"And after the league made with him, he shall worke deceitfully: for he shall come vp, and ouercome with a small people.","24":"He shall enter into the quiet and plentifull prouince, and he shall doe that which his fathers haue not done, nor his fathers fathers: he shal deuide among them the pray and the spoyle, and the substance, yea, and he shall forecast his deuises against the strong holdes, euen for a time.","25":"Also he shal stirre vp his power and his courage against the King of the South with a great armie, and the King of the South shall be stirred vp to battell with a very great and mightie armie: but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast and practise against him.","26":"Yea, they that feede of the portion of his meate, shall destroy him: & his armie shall ouerflowe: and many shall fall, and be slaine.","27":"And both these Kings hearts shall be to do mischiefe, and they shall talke of deceite at one table: but it shall not auaile: for yet the ende shall be at the time appointed.","28":"Then shall he returne into his land with great substance: for his heart shall be against the holy couenant: so shall he doe and returne to his owne land.","29":"At the time appointed he shall returne, and come toward the South: but the last shall not be as the first.","30":"For the shippes of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shalbe sorie and returne, and freat against the holy couenant: so shall he doe, he shall euen returne and haue intelligence with them that forsake the holy couenant.","31":"And armes shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the Sanctuarie of strength, and shall take away the dayly sacrifice, and they shall set vp the abominable desolation.","32":"And such as wickedly breake ye couenant, shall he cause to sinne by flatterie: but the people that do know their God, shall preuaile & prosper.","33":"And they that vnderstand among the people, shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by sword, & by flame, by captiuitie & by spoile many dayes.","34":"Nowe when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a litle helpe: but many shall cleaue vnto them fainedly.","35":"And some of the of vnderstanding shal fall to trie them, & to purge, & to make them white, till the time be out: for there is a time appointed.","36":"And the King shall doe what him list: he shall exalt himselfe, and magnifie himselfe against all, that is God, & shall speake marueilous things against ye God of gods, & shall prosper, till ye wrath be accomplished: for ye determination is made.","37":"Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desires of women, nor care for any God: for he shall magnifie himselfe aboue all.","38":"But in his place shall he honour the god Mauzzim, and the god whom his fathers knewe not, shall he honour with golde and with siluer, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.","39":"Thus shal he do in the holdes of Mauzzim with a strange god whom he shall acknowledge: he shall increase his glory, and shall cause them to rule ouer many and shall deuide ye land for gaine.","40":"And at ye end of time shall the King of the South push at him, & the king of the North shall come against him like a whirlewind with charets, & with horsemen, and with many ships, & he shall enter into ye countreis, & shal ouerflow & passe through.","41":"He shall enter also into the pleasant land, and many countreis shalbe ouerthrowen: but these shal escape out of his hand, euen Edom and Moab, and the chiefe of the children of Ammon.","42":"He shall stretch foorth his hands also vpon the countreis, and ye land of Egypt shall not escape.","43":"But he shall haue power ouer the treasures of golde and of siluer, and ouer all the precious things of Egypt, and of the Lybians, and of the blacke Mores where he shall passe.","44":"But the tidings out of the East & the North shall trouble him: therefore he shall goe foorth with great wrath to destroy & roote out many.","45":"And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace betweene the seas in the glorious and holy mountaine, yet he shal come to his end, and none shall helpe him."}
