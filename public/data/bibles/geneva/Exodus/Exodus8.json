{"1":"Afterward the Lorde sayde vnto Moses, Goe vnto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lorde, Let my people goe, that they may serue me:","2":"And if thou wilt not let them goe, beholde, I will smite all thy countrey with frogges:","3":"And the riuer shal scral ful of frogges, which shall goe vp and come into thine house, and into thy chamber, where thou sleepest, and vpon thy bed, and into the house of thy seruants, and vpon thy people, and into thine ouens, and into thy kneading troughes.","4":"Yea, the frogges shall climbe vp vpon thee, and on thy people, and vpon all thy seruants.","5":"Also the Lord said vnto Moses, Say thou vnto Aaron, Stretch out thine hande with thy rod vpon the streames, vpon the riuers, and vpon the ponds, and cause frogs to come vp vpon the land of Egypt.","6":"Then Aaron stretched out his hand vpon the waters of Egypt, and the frogges came vp, and couered the land of Egypt.","7":"And the sorcerers did likewise with their sorceries, and brought frogges vp vpon the land of Egypt.","8":"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Pray ye vnto the Lord, that hee may take away the frogges from mee, and from my people, and I will let the people goe, that they may doe sacrifice vnto the Lord.","9":"And Moses said vnto Pharaoh, Concerning me, euen command when I shall pray for thee, and for thy seruants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogges from thee and from thine houses, that they may remaine in the riuer only.","10":"Then he said, To morowe; he answered, Be it as thou hast said, that thou maiest know, that there is none like vnto the Lord our God.","11":"So the frogges shall depart from thee, and from thine houses, and from thy seruantes, and from thy people: onely they shall remaine in the riuer.","12":"Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cryed vnto the Lorde concerning the frogges, which hee had sent vnto Pharaoh.","13":"And the Lorde did according to the saying of Moses: so the frogges died in the houses, in the townes, and in the fieldes.","14":"And they gathered the together by heaps, and the land stanke of them.","15":"But when Pharaoh sawe that hee had rest giuen him, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not vnto them, as the Lord had said.","16":"Againe the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Stretche out the rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may bee turned to lyce throughout all the land of Egypt.","17":"And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth: and lyce came vpon man and vpon beast: all the dust of the earth was lyce throughout all the land of Egypt.","18":"Nowe the enchanters assaied likewise with their enchantments to bring forth lyce, but they could not. So the lyce were vpon man & vpon beast.","19":"Then saide the enchanters vnto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. But Pharaohs heart remained obstinate, and hee hearkened not vnto them, as the Lorde had said.","20":"Moreouer the Lorde sayd to Moses, Rise vp earely in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh (lo, hee will come forth vnto the water) and say vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serue me.","21":"Els, if thou wilt not let my people goe, behold, I will send swarmes of flies both vpon thee, and vpon thy seruants, and vpon thy people, and into thine houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shalbe full of swarmes of flies, and the ground also whereon they are.","22":"But ye land of Goshe, where my people are, wil I cause to be wonderfull in that day, so that no swarmes of flies shalbe there, that thou maiest know that I am the Lorde in the middes of the earth.","23":"And I will make a deliuerance of my people from thy people: to morowe shall this miracle be.","24":"And the Lorde did so: for there came great swarmes of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his seruants houses, so that through all the lande of Egypt, the earth was corrupt by the swarmes of flies.","25":"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and saide, Goe, doe sacrifice vnto your God in this lande.","26":"But Moses answered, It is not meete to do so: for then we shoulde offer vnto the Lorde our God that, which is an abomination vnto the Egyptians. Loe, can we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and they not stone vs?","27":"Let vs go three dayes iourney in the desert, and sacrifice vnto the Lord our God, as he hath commanded vs.","28":"And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice vnto the Lord your God in the wildernesse: but goe not farre away, pray for me.","29":"And Moses said, Behold, I will go out from thee, and pray vnto the Lord, that the swarmes of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people to morowe: but let Pharaoh from hencefoorth deceiue no more, in not suffering the people to sacrifice vnto the Lorde.","30":"So Moses went out from Pharaoh & prayed vnto the Lorde.","31":"And the Lord did according to the saying of Moses, and the swarmes of flies departed from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people, and there remained not one.","32":"Yet Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, and did not let the people goe."}
