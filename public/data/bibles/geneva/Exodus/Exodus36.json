So the people were stayed from offring.","7":"For the stuffe they had, was sufficient for all the worke to make it, and too much.","8":"All the cunning men therefore among the workemen, made for the Tabernacle ten curtaines of fine twined linnen, and of blewe silke, and purple, and skarlet: Cherubims of broydred worke made they vpon them.","9":"The length of one curtaine was twentie & eight cubits, & the breadth of one curtaine foure cubites: and the curtaines were all of one cise.","10":"And he coupled fiue curtaines together, & other fiue coupled he together.","11":"And he made strings of blewe silke by the edge of one curtaine, in the seluedge of the coupling: likewise he made on the side of the other curtaine in the seluedge in the second coupling.","12":"Fiftie strings made he in the one curtaine, and fiftie strings made he in the edge of the other curtaine, which was in the second coupling: the strings were set one against another.","13":"After, he made fiftie taches of golde, and coupled the curtaines one to another with the taches: so was it one Tabernacle.","14":"Also he made curtaines of goates heare for the couering vpon the Tabernacle: he made them to the nomber of eleuen curtaines.","15":"The length of one curtaine had thirtie cubites, & the bredth of one curtaine foure cubites: the eleuen curtaines were of one cise.","16":"And hee coupled fiue curtaines by themselues, and sixe curtaines by themselues:","17":"Also he made fiftie strings vpon the edge of one curtaine in the seluedge in the coupling, & fiftie strings made hee vpon the edge of the other curtaine in the second coupling.","18":"He made also fiftie taches of brasse to couple the couering that it might be one.","19":"And he made a couering vpon the pauilion of rams skinnes dyed red, and a couering of badgers skinnes aboue.","20":"Likewise he made the boards for the Tabernacle, of Shittim wood to stand vp.","21":"The length of a board was ten cubites, and the bredth of one board was a cubite, & an halfe.","22":"One board had two tenons, set in order as the feete of a ladder, one against another: thus made he for all the boardes of the Tabernacle.","23":"So he made twentie boardes for the South side of the Tabernacle, euen full South.","24":"And fourtie sockets of siluer made he vnder the twentie boardes, two sockets vnder one board for his two tenons, and two sockets vnder another board for his two tenons.","25":"Also for the other side of the Tabernacle toward the North, he made twentie boards,","26":"And their fourtie sockets of siluer, two sockets vnder one board, and two sockets vnder another boarde.","27":"Likewise toward the Westside of the Tabernacle he made sixe boardes.","28":"And two boardes made he in the corners of the Tabernacle, for either side,","29":"And they were ioyned beneath, and likewise were made sure aboue with a ring: thus he did to both in both corners.","30":"So there were eight boards & their sixteene sockets of siluer, vnder euery board two sockets.","31":"After, he made barres of Shittim wood, fiue for the boards in ye one side of ye Tabernacle,","32":"And fiue barres for the boardes in the other side of the Tabernacle, and fiue barres for the boards of the Tabernacle on the side toward the West.","33":"And he made the middest barre to shoote through the boards, from the one end to ye other.","34":"He ouerlayd also the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the barres, and couered the barres with golde.","35":"Moreouer he made a vaile of blew silke, and purple, & of skarlet, and of fine twined linen: with Cherubims of broydred worke made he it:","36":"And made thereunto foure pillars of Shittim, & ouerlayd them with golde: whose hookes were also of golde, and hee cast for them foure sockets of siluer.","37":"And he made an hanging for the Tabernacle doore, of blew silke, & purple, and skarlet, and fine twined linnen, and needle worke,","38":"And the fiue pillars of it with their hookes, and ouerlayde their chapiters & their filets with golde, but their fiue sockets were of brasse."}
