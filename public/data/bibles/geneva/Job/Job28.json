{"1":"The siluer surely hath his veyne, and ye gold his place, where they take it.","2":"Yron is taken out of the dust, and brasse is molten out of the stone.","3":"God putteth an end to darkenesse, and he tryeth the perfection of all things: he setteth a bond of darkenesse, and of the shadowe of death.","4":"The flood breaketh out against the inhabitant, and the waters forgotten of the foote, being higher then man, are gone away.","5":"Out of the same earth commeth bread, & vnder it, as it were fire is turned vp.","6":"The stones thereof are a place of saphirs, and the dust of it is golde.","7":"There is a path which no foule hath knowen, neyther hath the kites eye seene it.","8":"The lyons whelpes haue not walked it, nor the lyon passed thereby.","9":"He putteth his hand vpon the rockes, & ouerthroweth the mountaines by the rootes.","10":"He breaketh riuers in the rockes, and his eye seeth euery precious thing.","11":"He bindeth the floods, that they doe not ouerflowe, and the thing that is hid, bringeth he to light.","12":"But where is wisdome found? and where is the place of vnderstanding?","13":"Man knoweth not the price thereof: for it is not found in the land of the liuing.","14":"The depth sayth, It is not in mee: the sea also sayth, It is not with me.","15":"Golde shall not be giuen for it, neyther shall siluer be weighed for the price thereof.","16":"It shall not be valued with the wedge of golde of Ophir, nor with the precious onix, nor the saphir.","17":"The golde nor the chrystall shall be equall vnto it, nor the exchange shalbe for plate of fine golde.","18":"No mention shall be made of coral, nor of the gabish: for wisedome is more precious then pearles.","19":"The Topaz of Ethiopia shal not be equall vnto it, neither shall it be valued with the wedge of pure gold.","20":"Whence then commeth wisedome? And where is the place of vnderstanding,","21":"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all the liuing, and is hid from the foules of the heauen?","22":"Destruction and death say, We haue heard the fame thereof with our eares.","23":"But God vnderstandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.","24":"For he beholdeth the endes of the world, and seeth all that is vnder heauen,","25":"To make the weight of the windes, and to weigh the waters by measure.","26":"When he made a decree for the rayne, and a way for the lightening of the thunders,","27":"Then did he see it, and counted it: he prepared it and also considered it.","28":"And vnto man he said, Behold, the feare of the Lord is wisedome, and to depart from euil is vnderstanding."}
