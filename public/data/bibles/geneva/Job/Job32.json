{"1":"So these three men ceased to answere Iob, because he esteemed himselfe iust.","2":"Then the wrath of Elihu the sonne of Barachel the Buzite, of the familie of Ram, was kindled: his wrath, I say, was kindled against Iob, because he iustified himselfe more then God.","3":"Also his anger was kindled against his three friends, because they could not finde an answere, and yet condemned Iob.","4":"(Now Elihu had wayted til Iob had spoken: for they were more ancient in yeeres then he)","5":"So when Elihu saw, that there was none answere in the mouth of the three men, his wrath was kindled.","6":"Therefore Elihu the sonne of Barachel, the Buzite answered, & sayd, I am yong in yeres, and ye are ancient: therefore I doubted, and was afraide to shewe you mine opinion.","7":"For I said, The dayes shall speake, and the multitude of yeeres shall teach wisedome.","8":"Surely there is a spirite in man, but the inspiration of the Almightie giueth vnderstanding.","9":"Great men are not alway wise, neither doe the aged alway vnderstand iudgement.","10":"Therefore I say, Heare me, and I will shew also mine opinion.","11":"Behold, I did waite vpon your wordes, and hearkened vnto your knowledge, whiles you sought out reasons.","12":"Yea, when I had considered you, lo, there was none of you that reproued Iob, nor answered his wordes:","13":"Lest ye should say, We haue found wisedome: for God hath cast him downe, and no man.","14":"Yet hath he not directed his words to me, neyther will I answere him by your wordes.","15":"Then they fearing, answered no more, but left off their talke.","16":"When I had wayted (for they spake not, but stood still and answered no more)","17":"Then answered I in my turne, and I shewed mine opinion.","18":"For I am full of matter, and the spirite within me compelleth me.","19":"Beholde, my belly is as the wine, which hath no vent, and like the new bottels that brast.","20":"Therefore will I speake, that I may take breath: I will open my lippes, and will answere.","21":"I will not now accept the person of man, neyther will I giue titles to man.","22":"For I may not giue titles, lest my Maker should take me away suddenly."}
