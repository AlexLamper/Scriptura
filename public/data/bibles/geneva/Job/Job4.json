{"1":"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and sayde,","2":"If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieued? but who can withholde himselfe from speaking?","3":"Behold, thou hast taught many, and hast strengthened the wearie hands.","4":"Thy wordes haue confirmed him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the weake knees.","5":"But now it is come vpon thee, and thou art grieued: it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.","6":"Is not this thy feare, thy confidence, thy pacience, and the vprightnesse of thy wayes?","7":"Remember, I pray thee: who euer perished, being an innocent? or where were the vpright destroyed?","8":"As I haue seene, they that plow iniquitie, and sowe wickednesse, reape the same.","9":"With the blast of God they perish, and with the breath of his nostrels are they cosumed.","10":"The roaring of the Lion, and the voyce of the Lionesse, & the teeth of the Lions whelpes are broken.","11":"The Lyon perisheth for lacke of pray, and the Lyons whelpes are scattered abroade.","12":"But a thing was brought to me secretly, and mine eare hath receiued a litle thereof.","13":"In the thoughtes of ye visions of the night, when sleepe falleth on men,","14":"Feare came vpon me, & dread which made all my bones to tremble.","15":"And the wind passed before me, and made the heares of my flesh to stande vp.","16":"Then stoode one, and I knewe not his face: an image was before mine eyes, and in silence heard I a voyce, saying,","17":"Shall man be more iust then God? or shall a man be more pure then his maker?","18":"Beholde, he founde no stedfastnesse in his Seruants, and laid follie vpon his Angels.","19":"Howe much more in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which shalbe destroyed before the moth?","20":"They be destroyed from the morning vnto the euening: they perish for euer, without regarde.","21":"Doeth not their dignitie goe away with them? do they not die, & that without wisdom?"}
