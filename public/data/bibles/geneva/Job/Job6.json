{"1":"Bvt Iob answered, and said,","2":"Oh that my griefe were well weighed, and my miseries were layed together in the balance.","3":"For it woulde be nowe heauier then the sande of the sea: therefore my wordes are swallowed vp.","4":"For the arrowes of the Almightie are in me, the venime whereof doeth drinke vp my spirit, and the terrours of God fight against me.","5":"Doeth the wilde asse bray when he hath grasse? or loweth the oxe when he hath fodder?","6":"That which is vnsauerie, shall it be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egge?","7":"Such things as my soule refused to touch, as were sorowes, are my meate.","8":"Oh that I might haue my desire, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!","9":"That is, that God would destroy me: that he would let his hand go, and cut me off.","10":"Then should I yet haue comfort, (though I burne with sorowe, let him not spare) because I haue not denyed the wordes of the Holy one.","11":"What power haue I that I should endure? or what is mine end, if I should prolong my life?","12":"Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brasse?","13":"Is it not so, that there is in me no helpe? and that strength is taken from me?","14":"He that is in miserie, ought to be comforted of his neighbour: but men haue forsaken the feare of the Almightie.","15":"My brethre haue deceiued me as a brook, and as the rising of the riuers they passe away.","16":"Which are blackish with yee, and wherein the snowe is hid.","17":"But in time they are dryed vp with heate and are consumed: and when it is hote they faile out of their places,","18":"Or they depart from their way and course, yea, they vanish and perish.","19":"They that go to Tema, considered them, and they that goe to Sheba, waited for them.","20":"But they were confounded: when they hoped, they came thither and were ashamed.","21":"Surely nowe are ye like vnto it: ye haue seene my fearefull plague, and are afraide.","22":"Was it because I said, Bring vnto me? or giue a rewarde to me of your substance?","23":"And deliuer me from the enemies hande, or ransome me out of the hand of tyrants?","24":"Teach me, and I wil hold my tongue: & cause me to vnderstande, wherein I haue erred.","25":"Howe stedfast are the wordes of righteousnes? and what can any of you iustly reproue?","26":"Doe ye imagine to reproue wordes, that the talke of the afflicted should be as the winde?","27":"Ye make your wrath to fall vpon the fatherlesse, and dig a pit for your friende.","28":"Nowe therefore be content to looke vpon me: for I will not lie before your face.","29":"Turne, I pray you, let there be none iniquitie: returne, I say, and ye shall see yet my righteousnesse in that behalfe.","30":"Is there iniquitie in my tongue? doeth not my mouth feele sorowes?"}
