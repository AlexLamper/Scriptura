{"1":"(39:34) Moreouer ye Lord spake vnto Iob, & said,","2":"(39:35) Is this to learne to striue with the Almightie? he that reprooueth God, let him answere to it.","3":"(39:36) Then Iob answered the Lord, saying,","4":"(39:37) Beholde, I am vile: what shall I answere thee? I will lay mine hand vpon my mouth.","5":"(39:38) Once haue I spoken, but I will answere no more, yea twise, but I will proceede no further.","6":"(40:1) Againe the Lord answered Iob out of the whirle winde, and said,","7":"(40:2) Girde vp now thy loynes like a man: I will demaunde of thee, and declare thou vnto me.","8":"(40:3) Wilt thou disanul my iudgement? or wilt thou condemne me, that thou mayst be iustified?","9":"(40:4) Or hast thou an arme like God? or doest thou thunder with a voyce like him?","10":"(40:5) Decke thy selfe now with maiestie & excellencie, & aray thy selfe with beautie & glory.","11":"(40:6) Cast abroad the indignation of thy wrath, and beholde euery one that is proude, and abase him.","12":"(40:7) Looke on euery one that is arrogant, and bring him lowe: and destroy the wicked in their place.","13":"(40:8) Hide them in the dust together, and binde their faces in a secret place.","14":"(40:9) Then will I confesse vnto thee also, that thy right hand can saue thee.","15":"(40:10) Behold now Behemoth (whom I made with thee) which eateth grasse as an oxe.","16":"(40:11) Behold now, his strength is in his loynes, and his force is in the nauil of his belly.","17":"(40:12) When hee taketh pleasure, his taile is like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapt together.","18":"(40:13) His bones are like staues of brasse, and his small bones like staues of yron.","19":"(40:14) He is the chiefe of the wayes of God: he that made him, will make his sworde to approch vnto him.","20":"(40:15) Surely the mountaines bring him foorth grasse, where all the beastes of the fielde play.","21":"(40:16) Lyeth hee vnder the trees in the couert of the reede and fennes?","22":"(40:17) Can the trees couer him with their shadow? or can the willowes of the riuer compasse him about?","23":"(40:18) Behold, he spoyleth the riuer, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw vp Iorden into his mouth.","24":"(40:19) Hee taketh it with his eyes, and thrusteth his nose through whatsoeuer meeteth him."}
