{"1":"Bvt Iob answered, and said,","2":"I haue oft times heard such things: miserable comforters are ye all.","3":"Shall there be none ende of wordes of winde? or what maketh thee bold so to answere?","4":"I could also speake as yee doe: (but woulde God your soule were in my soules stead) I could keepe you company in speaking, and could shake mine head at you,","5":"But I woulde strengthen you with my mouth, and the comfort of my lips should asswage your sorowe.","6":"Though I speake, my sorow can not be asswaged: though I cease, what release haue I?","7":"But now hee maketh mee wearie: O God, thou hast made all my congregation desolate,","8":"And hast made me full of wrinkles which is a witnesse thereof, and my leannes ryseth vp in me, testifying the same in my face.","9":"His wrath hath torne me, and hee hateth me, and gnasheth vpon mee with his teeth: mine enemie hath sharpened his eyes against me.","10":"They haue opened their mouthes vpon me, and smitten me on the cheeke in reproch; they gather themselues together against me.","11":"God hath deliuered me to the vniust, and hath made mee to turne out of the way by the hands of the wicked.","12":"I was in welth, but he hath brought me to nought: he hath taken me by the necke, and beaten me, and set me as a marke for himselfe.","13":"His archers compasse mee rounde about: he cutteth my reines, and doth not spare, & powreth my gall vpon the ground.","14":"He hath broken me with one breaking vpon another, and runneth vpon me like a gyant.","15":"I haue sowed a sackcloth vpon my skinne, and haue abased mine horne vnto the dust.","16":"My face is withered with weeping, and the shadow of death is vpon mine eyes,","17":"Though there be no wickednesse in mine hands, and my prayer be pure.","18":"O earth, couer not thou my blood, & let my crying finde no place.","19":"For lo, now my witnesse is in the heauen, and my record is on hie.","20":"My friends speake eloquently against me: but mine eye powreth out teares vnto God.","21":"Oh that a man might pleade with God, as man with his neighbour!","22":"For the yeeres accounted come, and I shal go the way, whence I shall not returne."}
