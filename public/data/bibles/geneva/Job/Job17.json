{"1":"My breath is corrupt: my dayes are cut off, & the graue is readie for me.","2":"There are none but mockers with mee, & mine eye continueth in their bitternesse.","3":"Lay downe nowe and put me in suretie for thee: who is hee, that will touch mine hand?","4":"For thou hast hid their heart from vnderstanding: therefore shalt thou not set them vp on hie.","5":"For the eyes of his children shall faile, that speaketh flattery to his friends.","6":"Hee hath also made mee a byword of the people, and I am as a Tabret before them.","7":"Mine eye therefore is dimme for griefe, and all my strength is like a shadowe.","8":"The righteous shalbe astonied at this, and the innocent shalbe moued against ye hypocrite.","9":"But the righteous wil holde his way, & he whose hands are pure, shall increase his strength.","10":"All you therefore turne you, and come nowe, and I shall not finde one wise among you.","11":"My dayes are past, mine enterprises are broken, and the thoughts of mine heart","12":"Haue changed the nyght for the day, and the light that approched, for darkenesse.","13":"Though I hope, yet the graue shall bee mine house, and I shal make my bed in the darke.","14":"I shall say to corruption, Thou art my father, and to the worme, Thou art my mother and my sister.","15":"Where is then now mine hope? or who shal consider the thing, that I hoped for?","16":"They shal goe downe into the bottome of the pit: surely it shall lye together in the dust."}
