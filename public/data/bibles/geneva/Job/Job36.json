{"1":"Elihu also proceeded and sayde,","2":"Suffer me a litle, and I will instruct thee: for I haue yet to speake on Gods behalfe.","3":"I will fetche my knowledge afarre off, & will attribute rigteousnesse vnto my Maker.","4":"For truely my wordes shall not be false, and he that is perfect in knowledge, speaketh with thee.","5":"Behold, the mighty God casteth away none that is mighty and valiant of courage.","6":"He mainteineth not the wicked, but he giueth iudgement to the afflicted.","7":"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but they are with Kings in ye throne, where he placeth them for euer: thus they are exalted.","8":"And if they bee bound in fetters and tyed with the cordes of affliction,","9":"Then will he shewe them their worke and their sinnes, because they haue bene proude.","10":"He openeth also their eare to discipline, and commandeth them that they returne fro iniquity.","11":"If they obey and serue him, they shal end their dayes in prosperity, & their yeres in pleasures.","12":"But if they wil not obey, they shal passe by the sworde, and perish without knowledge.","13":"But the hypocrites of heart increase the wrath: for they call not when he bindeth them.","14":"Their soule dyeth in youth, and their life among the whoremongers.","15":"He deliuereth the poore in his affliction, & openeth their eare in trouble.","16":"Euen so woulde he haue taken thee out of the streight place into a broade place and not shut vp beneath: and that which resteth vpon thy table, had bene full of fat.","17":"But thou art ful of the iudgement of the wicked, though iudgement and equitie maintaine all things.","18":"For Gods wrath is, least hee should take that away in thine abundance: for no multitude of giftes can deliuer thee.","19":"Wil he regard thy riches? he regardeth not golde, nor all them that excel in strength.","20":"Be not carefull in the night, howe he destroyeth the people out of their place.","21":"Take thou heede: looke not to iniquitie: for thou hast chosen it rather then affliction.","22":"Beholde, God exalteth by his power: what teacher is like him?","23":"Who hath appointed to him his way? or who can say, Thou hast done wickedly?","24":"Remember that thou magnifie his worke, which men behold.","25":"All men see it, and men beholde it afarre off.","26":"Beholde, God is excellent, and we knowe him not, neither can the nomber of his yeres bee searched out.","27":"When he restraineth the droppes of water, the rayne powreth down by the vapour thereof,","28":"Which raine the cloudes do droppe and let fall abundantly vpon man.","29":"Who can know the diuisions of ye clouds and the thunders of his tabernacle?","30":"Beholde, he spreadeth his light vpon it, and couereth the bottome of the sea.","31":"For thereby hee iudgeth the people, and giueth meate abundantly.","32":"He couereth the light with the clouds, and commandeth them to go against it.","33":"His companion sheweth him thereof, and there is anger in rising vp."}
