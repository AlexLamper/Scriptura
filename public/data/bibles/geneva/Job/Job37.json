{"1":"At this also mine heart is astonied, & is mooued out of his place.","2":"Heare the sound of his voyce, and the noyse that goeth out of his mouth.","3":"He directeth it vnder the whole heauen, and his light vnto the endes of the world.","4":"After it a noyse soundeth: hee thundereth with the voyce of his maiestie, and hee will not stay them when his voyce is heard.","5":"God thundereth marueilously with his voyce: he worketh great things, which we know not.","6":"For he sayth to the snowe, Be thou vpon the earth: likewise to the small rayne and to the great rayne of his power.","7":"With the force thereof he shutteth vp euery man, that all men may knowe his worke.","8":"Then the beastes go into the denne, and remaine in their places.","9":"The whirlewind commeth out of the South, and the colde from the North winde.","10":"At the breath of God the frost is giuen, & the breadth of the waters is made narrowe.","11":"He maketh also the cloudes to labour, to water the earth, and scattereth the cloude of his light.","12":"And it is turned about by his gouernment, that they may doe whatsoeuer he commandeth them vpon the whole worlde:","13":"Whether it be for punishment, or for his lande, or of mercie, he causeth it to come.","14":"Hearken vnto this, O Iob: stand and consider the wonderous workes of God.","15":"Diddest thou knowe when God disposed them? & caused the light of his cloud to shine?","16":"Hast thou knowen the varietie of the cloude, and the wonderous workes of him, that is perfite in knowledge?","17":"Or howe thy clothes are warme, when he maketh the earth quiet through the South winde?","18":"Hast thou stretched out the heaues, which are strong, and as a molten glasse?","19":"Tell vs what we shall say vnto him: for we can not dispose our matter because of darknes.","20":"Shall it be told him when I speake? Or shall man speake when he shalbe destroyed?","21":"And nowe men see not the light, which shineth in the cloudes, but the winde passeth and clenseth them.","22":"The brightnesse commeth out of the North: the praise thereof is to God, which is terrible.","23":"It is the Almightie: we can not finde him out: he is excellent in power and iudgement, & aboundant in iustice: he afflicteth not.","24":"Let men therefore feare him: for he will not regarde any that are wise in their owne conceit."}
