{"1":"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and sayde,","2":"Should not the multitude of wordes be answered? or should a great talker be iustified?","3":"Should men holde their peace at thy lyes? & when thou mockest others, shall none make thee ashamed?","4":"For thou hast sayde, My doctrine is pure, and I am cleane in thine eyes.","5":"But, oh that God would speake and open his lippes against thee!","6":"That he might shewe thee the secretes of wisedome, howe thou hast deserued double, according to right: know therefore that God hath forgotten thee for thine iniquitie.","7":"Canst thou by searching finde out God? canst thou finde out ye Almighty to his perfection?","8":"The heauens are hie, what canst thou doe? it is deeper then the hel, how canst thou know it?","9":"The measure thereof is longer then the earth, and it is broader then the sea.","10":"If hee cut off and shut vp, or gather together, who can turne him backe?","11":"For hee knoweth vaine men, and seeth iniquitie, and him that vnderstandeth nothing.","12":"Yet vaine man would be wise, though man new borne is like a wilde asse colte.","13":"If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him:","14":"If iniquitie be in thine hand, put it farre away, and let no wickednesse dwell in thy Tabernacle.","15":"The truely shalt thou lift vp thy face without spot, and shalt be stable, and shalt not feare.","16":"But thou shalt forget thy miserie, and remember it as waters that are past.","17":"Thine age also shall appeare more cleare then the noone day: thou shalt shine and bee as the morning.","18":"And thou shalt bee bolde, because there is hope: and thou shalt digge pittes, and shalt lye downe safely.","19":"For when thou takest thy rest, none shal make thee afraide: yea, many shall make sute vnto thee.","20":"But the eyes of the wicked shall faile, and their refuge shall perish, and their hope shalbe sorow of minde."}
