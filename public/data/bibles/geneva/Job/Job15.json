{"1":"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and saide,","2":"Shal a wise man speake words of ye winde, and fill his bellie with the East winde?","3":"Shall he dispute with wordes not comely? or with talke that is not profitable?","4":"Surely thou hast cast off feare, and restrainest prayer before God.","5":"For thy mouth declareth thine iniquitie, seeing thou hast chosen ye tongue of the crafty.","6":"Thine owne mouth condemneth thee, and not I, and thy lippes testifie against thee.","7":"Art thou the first man, that was borne? and wast thou made before the hils?","8":"Hast thou heard the secret counsell of God, and doest thou restraine wisedome to thee?","9":"What knowest thou that we knowe not? and vnderstandest that is not in vs?","10":"With vs are both auncient and very aged men, farre older then thy father.","11":"Seeme the consolations of God smal vnto thee? is this thing strange vnto thee?","12":"Why doeth thine heart take thee away, and what doe thine eyes meane,","13":"That thou answerest to God at thy pleasure, and bringest such wordes out of thy mouth?","14":"What is man, that he should be cleane? and he that is borne of woman, that he shoulde be iust?","15":"Beholde, he founde no stedfastnesse in his Saintes: yea, the heauens are not cleane in his sight.","16":"How much more is man abominable, and filthie, which drinketh iniquitie like water?","17":"I will tell thee: heare me, and I will declare that which I haue seene:","18":"Which wise men haue tolde, as they haue heard of their fathers, and haue not kept it secret:","19":"To whome alone the land was giuen and no stranger passed through them.","20":"The wicked man is continually as one that traueileth of childe, and the nomber of yeeres is hid from the tyrant.","21":"A sounde of feare is in his eares, and in his prosperitie the destroyer shall come vpon him.","22":"He beleeueth not to returne out of darknesse: for he seeth the sworde before him.","23":"He wandreth to and fro for bread where he may: he knoweth that the day of darkenesse is prepared at hande.","24":"Affliction and anguish shall make him afraide: they shall preuaile against him as a King readie to the battell.","25":"For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and made him selfe strong against the Almightie.","26":"Therefore God shall runne vpon him, euen vpon his necke, and against the most thicke part of his shielde.","27":"Because he hath couered his face with his fatnesse, and hath colloppes in his flancke.","28":"Though he dwell in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, but are become heapes,","29":"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof in the earth.","30":"He shall neuer depart out of darkenesse: the flame shall drie vp his branches, and he shall goe away with the breath of his mouth.","31":"He beleeueth not that he erreth in vanitie: therefore vanitie shalbe his change.","32":"His branch shall not be greene, but shall be cut off before his day.","33":"God shall destroy him as the vine her sower grape, and shall cast him off, as the oliue doeth her flowre.","34":"For the congregation of the hypocrite shalbe desolate, and fire shall deuoure the houses of bribes.","35":"For they conceiue mischiefe and bring foorth vanitie, and their bellie hath prepared deceite."}
