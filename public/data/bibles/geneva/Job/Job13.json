{"1":"Loe, mine eye hath seene all this: mine eare hath heard, and vnderstande it.","2":"I knowe also as much as you knowe: I am not inferiour vnto you.","3":"But I will speake to the Almightie, and I desire to dispute with God.","4":"For in deede ye forge lyes, and all you are physitions of no value.","5":"Oh, that you woulde holde your tongue, that it might be imputed to you for wisedome!","6":"Nowe heare my disputation, and giue eare to the arguments of my lips.","7":"Will ye speake wickedly for Gods defence, and talke deceitfully for his cause?","8":"Will ye accept his person? or will ye contende for God?","9":"Is it well that he shoulde seeke of you? will you make a lye for him, as one lyeth for a man?","10":"He will surely reprooue you, if ye doe secretly accept any person.","11":"Shall not his excellencie make you afraid? and his feare fall vpon you?","12":"Your memories may be compared vnto ashes, and your bodyes to bodyes of clay.","13":"Holde your tongues in my presence, that I may speake, and let come vpon what will.","14":"Wherefore doe I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my soule in mine hande?","15":"Loe, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him, and I will reprooue my wayes in his sight.","16":"He shalbe my saluation also: for the hypocrite shall not come before him.","17":"Heare diligently my wordes, and marke my talke.","18":"Beholde nowe: if I prepare me to iudgement, I knowe that I shalbe iustified.","19":"Who is he, that will pleade with me? for if I nowe holde my tongue, I dye.","20":"But doe not these two things vnto me: then will I not hide my selfe from thee.","21":"Withdrawe thine hande from me, and let not thy feare make me afraide.","22":"Then call thou, and I will answere: or let me speake, and answere thou me.","23":"Howe many are mine iniquities & sinnes? shewe me my rebellion, and my sinne.","24":"Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and takest me for thine enemie?","25":"Wilt thou breake a leafe driuen to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the drie stubble?","26":"For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possesse the iniquities of my youth.","27":"Thou puttest my feete also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly vnto all my pathes, and makest the print thereof in ye heeles of my feet.","28":"Such one consumeth like a rotten thing, and as a garment that is motheaten."}
