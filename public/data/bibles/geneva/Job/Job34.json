{"1":"Moreouer Elihu answered, and saide,","2":"Heare my wordes, ye wise men, and hearken vnto me, ye that haue knowledge.","3":"For the eare tryeth the words, as the mouth tasteth meate.","4":"Let vs seeke iudgement among vs, and let vs knowe among our selues what is good.","5":"For Iob hath saide, I am righteous, & God hath taken away my iudgement.","6":"Should I lye in my right? my wound of the arrowe is grieuous without my sinne.","7":"What man is like Iob, that drinketh scornfulnesse like water?","8":"Which goeth in the companie of them that worke iniquitie, and walketh with wicked men?","9":"For he hath saide, It profiteth a man nothing that he should walke with God.","10":"Therefore hearken vnto me, ye men of wisedome, God forbid that wickednesse should be in God, and iniquitie in the Almightie.","11":"For he will render vnto man according to his worke, and cause euery one to finde according to his way.","12":"And certainely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almightie peruert iudgement.","13":"Whome hath he appointed ouer the earth beside him selfe? or who hath placed the whole worlde?","14":"If he set his heart vpon man, and gather vnto him selfe his spirit and his breath,","15":"All flesh shal perish together, and man shal returne vnto dust.","16":"And if thou hast vnderstanding, heare this and hearken to the voyce of my wordes.","17":"Shal he that hateth iudgement, gouerne? & wilt thou iudge him wicked that is most iust?","18":"Wilt thou say vnto a King, Thou art wicked? or to princes, Ye are vngodly?","19":"How much lesse to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, & regardeth not the rich, more then the poore? for they be all the worke of his handes.","20":"They shall die suddenly, and the people shalbe troubled at midnight, & they shall passe foorth and take away the mightie without hand.","21":"For his eyes are vpon the wayes of man, and he seeth all his goings.","22":"There is no darkenesse nor shadowe of death, that the workers of iniquitie might be hid therein.","23":"For he will not lay on man so much, that he should enter into iudgement with God.","24":"He shall breake the mightie without seeking, and shall set vp other in their stead.","25":"Therefore shall he declare their works: he shall turne the night, & they shalbe destroyed.","26":"He striketh them as wicked men in the places of the seers,","27":"Because they haue turned backe from him, and would not consider all his wayes:","28":"So that they haue caused the voyce of the poore to come vnto him, and he hath heard the cry of the afflicted.","29":"And when he giueth quietnesse, who can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who can beholde him, whether it be vpon nations, or vpon a man onely?","30":"Because the hypocrite doeth reigne, and because the people are snared.","31":"Surely it appertaineth vnto God to say, I haue pardoned, I will not destroy.","32":"But if I see not, teach thou me: if I haue done wickedly, I will doe no more.","33":"Wil he performe the thing through thee? for thou hast reproued it, because that thou hast chosen, & not I. now speake what thou knowest.","34":"Let men of vnderstanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken vnto me.","35":"Iob hath not spoken of knowledge, neyther were his wordes according to wisedome.","36":"I desire that Iob may be tryed, vnto the ende touching the answeres for wicked men.","37":"For he addeth rebellion vnto his sinne: he clappeth his handes among vs, and multiplieth his wordes against God."}
