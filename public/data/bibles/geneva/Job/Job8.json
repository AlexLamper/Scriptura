{"1":"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and saide,","2":"Howe long wilt thou talke of these things? and howe long shall the wordes of thy mouth be as a mightie winde?","3":"Doeth God peruert iudgement? or doeth the Almightie subuert iustice?","4":"If thy sonnes haue sinned against him, and he hath sent them into the place of their iniquitie,","5":"Yet if thou wilt early seeke vnto God, and pray to the Almightie,","6":"If thou be pure and vpright, then surely hee will awake vp vnto thee, and he wil make the habitation of thy righteousnesse prosperous.","7":"And though thy beginning be small, yet thy latter ende shall greatly encrease.","8":"Inquire therefore, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thy selfe to search of their fathers.","9":"(For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant: for our dayes vpon earth are but a shadowe)","10":"Shall not they teach thee and tell thee, and vtter the wordes of their heart?","11":"Can a rush grow without myre? or can ye grasse growe without water?","12":"Though it were in greene and not cutte downe, yet shall it wither before any other herbe.","13":"So are the paths of al that forget God, and the hypocrites hope shall perish.","14":"His confidence also shalbe cut off, and his trust shalbe as the house of a spyder.","15":"He shall leane vpon his house, but it shall not stand: he shal holde him fast by it, yet shall it not endure.","16":"The tree is greene before the sunne, and the branches spread ouer the garden thereof.","17":"The rootes thereof are wrapped about the fountaine, and are folden about ye house of stones.","18":"If any plucke it from his place, and it denie, saying, I haue not seene thee,","19":"Beholde, it will reioyce by this meanes, that it may growe in another molde.","20":"Behold, God will not cast away an vpright man, neither will he take the wicked by the hand,","21":"Till he haue filled thy mouth with laughter, and thy lippes with ioy.","22":"They that hate thee, shall be clothed with shame, and the dwelling of the wicked shall not remaine."}
