{"1":"Bvt Iob answered and sayd,","2":"Though my talke be this day in bitternes, and my plague greater then my groning,","3":"Would God yet I knew how to finde him, I would enter vnto his place.","4":"I would pleade the cause before him, & fill my mouth with arguments.","5":"I would knowe the wordes, that he would answere me, & would vnderstand what he would say vnto me.","6":"Would he plead against me with his great power? No, but he would put strength in me.","7":"There the righteous might reason with him, so I shoulde be deliuered for euer from my Iudge.","8":"Behold, if I go to the East, he is not there: if to the West, yet I can not perceiue him:","9":"If to the North where he worketh, yet I cannot see him: he wil hide himselfe in the South, and I cannot beholde him.","10":"But he knoweth my way, & trieth mee, and I shal come forth like the gold.","11":"My foote hath followed his steps: his way haue I kept, and haue not declined.","12":"Neyther haue I departed from the commandement of his lippes, and I haue esteemed the words of his mouth more then mine appointed foode.","13":"Yet he is in one minde, & who can turne him? yea, he doeth what his minde desireth.","14":"For he will performe that, which is decreed of me, and many such things are with him.","15":"Therefore I am troubled at his presence, & in considering it, I am afraid of him.","16":"For God hath softened mine heart, & the Almightie hath troubled me.","17":"For I am not cut off in darknesse, but he hath hid the darkenesse from my face."}
