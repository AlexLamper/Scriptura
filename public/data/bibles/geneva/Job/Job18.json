{"1":"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,","2":"When will yee make an ende of your words? cause vs to vnderstande, and then wee will speake.","3":"Wherefore are wee counted as beastes, and are vile in your sight?","4":"Thou art as one that teareth his soule in his anger. Shall the earth bee forsaken for thy sake? or the rocke remoued out of his place?","5":"Yea, the light of the wicked shalbe quenched, and the sparke of his fire shall not shine.","6":"The light shalbe darke in his dwelling, and his candle shalbe put out with him.","7":"The steps of his strength shalbe restrained, and his owne counsell shall cast him downe.","8":"For hee is taken in the net by his feete, and he walketh vpon the snares.","9":"The grenne shall take him by the heele, and the theefe shall come vpon him.","10":"A snare is layed for him in the ground, and a trappe for him in the way.","11":"Fearefulnesse shall make him afrayde on euery side, and shall driue him to his feete.","12":"His strength shalbe famine: and destruction shalbe readie at his side.","13":"It shall deuoure the inner partes of his skinne, and the first borne of death shall deuoure his strength.","14":"His hope shalbe rooted out of his dwelling, & shal cause him to go to the King of feare.","15":"Feare shall dwell in his house (because it is not his) and brimstone shalbe scattered vpon his habitation.","16":"His rootes shalbe dryed vp beneath, and aboue shall his branche be cut downe.","17":"His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall haue no name in the streete.","18":"They shall driue him out of the light vnto darkenesse, and chase him out of the world.","19":"Hee shall neither haue sonne nor nephewe among his people, nor any posteritie in his dwellings.","20":"The posteritie shalbe astonied at his day, and feare shall come vpon the ancient.","21":"Surely such are the habitations of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God."}
