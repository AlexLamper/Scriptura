{"1":"Elihu spake moreouer, and said,","2":"Thinkest thou this right, that thou hast said, I am more righteous then God?","3":"For thou hast said, What profiteth it thee and what auaileth it me, to purge me fro my sinne?","4":"Therefore will I answere thee, & thy companions with thee.","5":"Looke vnto the heauen, and see and behold the cloudes which are hyer then thou.","6":"If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him, yea, when thy sinnes be many, what doest thou vnto him?","7":"If thou be righteous, what giuest thou vnto him? or what receiueth he at thine hand?","8":"Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou art: and thy righteousnes may profite ye sonne of man.","9":"They cause many that are oppressed, to crye, which crye out for ye violence of the mightie.","10":"But none saieth, Where is God that made me, which giueth songs in the nyght?","11":"Which teacheth vs more then the beastes of the earth, and giueth vs more wisdome then the foules of the heauen.","12":"Then they crye because of the violence of the wicked, but he answereth not.","13":"Surely God will not heare vanitie, neyther will the Almightie regard it.","14":"Although thou sayest to God, Thou wilt not regard it, yet iudgement is before him: trust thou in him.","15":"But nowe because his anger hath not visited, nor called to count the euill with great extremitie,","16":"Therfore Iob openeth his mouth in vaine, and multiplieth wordes without knowledge."}
