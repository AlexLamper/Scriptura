{"1":"Wherefore, Iob, I pray thee, heare my talke and hearken vnto all my wordes.","2":"Beholde now, I haue opened my mouth: my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.","3":"My words are in the vprightnesse of mine heart, & my lippes shall speake pure knowledge.","4":"The Spirite of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almightie hath giuen me life.","5":"If thou canst giue me answere, prepare thy selfe and stand before me.","6":"Beholde, I am according to thy wish in Gods stead: I am also formed of the clay.","7":"Beholde, my terrour shall not feare thee, neither shall mine hand be heauie vpon thee.","8":"Doubtles thou hast spoken in mine eares, and I haue heard the voyce of thy wordes.","9":"I am cleane, without sinne: I am innocent, and there is none iniquitie in me.","10":"Lo, he hath found occasions against me, and counted me for his enemie.","11":"He hath put my feete in the stockes, and looketh narrowly vnto all my paths.","12":"Behold, in this hast thou not done right: I will answere thee, that God is greater then man.","13":"Why doest thou striue against him? for he doeth not giue account of all his matters.","14":"For God speaketh once or twise, and one seeth it not.","15":"In dreames and visions of the night, when sleepe falleth vpon men, and they sleepe vpon their beds,","16":"Then he openeth the eares of men, euen by their corrections, which he had sealed,","17":"That he might cause man to turne away from his enterprise, and that he might hide the pride of man,","18":"And keepe backe his soule from the pit, & that his life should not passe by the sword.","19":"He is also striken with sorow vpon his bed, and the griefe of his bones is sore,","20":"So that his life causeth him to abhorre bread, and his soule daintie meate.","21":"His flesh faileth that it can not be seene, and his bones which were not seene, clatter.","22":"So his soule draweth to the graue, and his life to the buriers.","23":"If there be a messenger with him, or an interpreter, one of a thousand to declare vnto man his righteousnesse,","24":"Then will he haue mercie vpon him, and will say, Deliuer him, that he go not downe into the pit: for I haue receiued a reconciliation.","25":"Then shal his flesh be as fresh as a childes, and shall returne as in the dayes of his youth.","26":"He shall pray vnto God, and he will be fauourable vnto him, and he shall see his face with ioy: for he will render vnto ma his righteousnes.","27":"He looketh vpon men, and if one say, I haue sinned, and peruerted righteousnesse, and it did not profite me,","28":"He will deliuer his soule from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.","29":"Lo, all these things will God worke twise or thrise with a man,","30":"That he may turne backe his soule from the pit, to be illuminate in the light of the liuing.","31":"Marke well, O Iob, and heare me: keepe silence, and I will speake.","32":"If there be matter, answere me, and speak: for I desire to iustifie thee.","33":"If thou hast not, heare me: holde thy tongue, and I will teach thee wisedome."}
