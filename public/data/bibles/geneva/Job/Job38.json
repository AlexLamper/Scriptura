{"1":"Then answered the Lord vnto Iob out of the whirle winde, and said,","2":"Who is this that darkeneth the counsell by wordes without knowledge?","3":"Girde vp nowe thy loynes like a man: I will demande of thee & declare thou vnto me.","4":"Where wast thou when I layd the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast vnderstanding,","5":"Who hath layde the measures thereof, if thou knowest, or who hath stretched the line ouer it:","6":"Whereupon are the foundations thereof set: or who layed the corner stone thereof:","7":"When the starres of the morning praysed me together, and all the children of God reioyced:","8":"Or who hath shut vp the Sea with doores, when it yssued and came foorth as out of the wombe:","9":"When I made the cloudes as a couering thereof, and darkenesse as the swadeling bands thereof:","10":"When I stablished my commandement vpon it, and set barres and doores,","11":"And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no farther, and here shall it stay thy proude waues.","12":"Hast thou commanded the morning since thy dayes? Hast thou caused the morning to knowe his place,","13":"That it might take hold of the corners of the earth, and that the wicked might be shaken out of it?","14":"It is turned as clay to facion, and all stand vp as a garment.","15":"And from the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the hie arme shalbe broken.","16":"Hast thou entred into the bottomes of the sea? Or hast thou walked to seeke out the depth?","17":"Haue the gates of death bene opened vnto thee? Or hast thou seene the gates of the shadowe of death?","18":"Hast thou perceiued the breadth of the earth? Tell if thou knowest all this.","19":"Where is the way where light dwelleth? And where is the place of darkenesse,","20":"That thou shouldest receiue it in the boundes thereof, and that thou shouldest knowe the paths to the house thereof?","21":"Knewest thou it, because thou wast then borne, and because the nomber of thy dayes is great?","22":"Hast thou entred into the treasures of the snow? Or hast thou seene the treasures of ye haile,","23":"Which I haue hid against the time of trouble, against the day of warre and battell?","24":"By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the East winde vpon the earth?","25":"Who hath deuided the spowtes for the raine? Or the way for the lightning of ye thunders,","26":"To cause it to raine on the earth where no man is, and in the wildernes where there is no man?","27":"To fulfil the wilde and waste place, and to cause the bud of the herbe to spring forth?","28":"Who is the father of the rayne? Or who hath begotten the droppes of the dewe?","29":"Out of whose wombe came the yee? Who hath ingendred the frost of the heauen?","30":"The waters are hid as with a stone: and the face of the depth is frosen.","31":"Canst thou restraine the sweete influences of the Pleiades? Or loose the bandes of Orion?","32":"Canst thou bring foorth Mazzaroth in their time? Canst thou also guide Arcturus with his sonnes?","33":"Knowest thou the course of heauen, or canst thou set the rule thereof in the earth?","34":"Canst thou lift vp thy voice to the cloudes that the aboundance of water may couer thee?","35":"Canst thou sende the lightenings that they may walke, and say vnto thee, Loe, heere we are?","36":"Who hath put wisedome in the reines? Or who hath giuen the heart vnderstanding?","37":"Who can nomber cloudes by wisedome? Or who can cause to cease the bottels of heaue,","38":"When the earth groweth into hardnesse, and the clottes are fast together?","39":"(39:1) Wilt thou hunt the pray for the lyon? or fill the appetite of the lyons whelpes,","40":"(39:2) When they couch in their places, and remaine in the couert to lye in waite?","41":"(39:3) Who prepareth for the rauen his meate, when his birdes crie vnto God, wandering for lacke of meate?"}
