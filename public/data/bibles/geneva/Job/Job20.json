{"1":"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite and saide,","2":"Doubtles my thoughts cause me to answere, and therefore I make haste.","3":"I haue heard the correction of my reproch: therefore the spirite of mine vnderstanding causeth me to answere.","4":"Knowest thou not this of olde? and since God placed man vpon the earth,","5":"That the reioycing of the wicked is short, and that the ioy of hypocrites is but a moment?","6":"Though his excellencie mount vp to the heauen, and his head reache vnto the cloudes,","7":"Yet shall hee perish for euer, like his dung, and they which haue seene him, shall say, Where is hee?","8":"He shal flee away as a dreame, and they shal not finde him, and shall passe away as a vision of the night,","9":"So that the eye which had seene him, shall do so no more, & his place shal see him no more.","10":"His children shall flatter the poore, & his hands shall restore his substance.","11":"His bones are full of the sinne of his youth, and it shal lie downe with him in the dust.","12":"When wickednesse was sweete in his mouth, and he hid it vnder his tongue,","13":"And fauoured it, and would not forsake it, but kept it close in his mouth,","14":"Then his meat in his bowels was turned: the gall of Aspes was in the middes of him.","15":"He hath deuoured substance, and hee shall vomit it: for God shall drawe it out of his bellie.","16":"He shall sucke the gall of Aspes, and the vipers tongue shall slay him.","17":"He shall not see the riuers, nor the floods and streames of honie and butter.","18":"He shal restore the labour, and shall deuoure no more: euen according to the substance shalbe his exchange, & he shal enioy it no more.","19":"For he hath vndone many: he hath forsaken the poore, and hath spoyled houses which he builded not.","20":"Surely he shall feele no quietnes in his bodie, neither shall he reserue of that which he desired.","21":"There shall none of his meate bee left: therefore none shal hope for his goods.","22":"When he shalbe filled with his abundance, he shalbe in paine, and the hand of all the wicked shall assaile him.","23":"He shall be about to fill his belly, but God shall sende vpon him his fierce wrath, and shall cause to rayne vpon him, euen vpon his meate.","24":"He shall flee from the yron weapons, and the bow of steele shal strike him through.","25":"The arrowe is drawen out, and commeth forth of the body, & shineth of his gall, so feare commeth vpon him.","26":"All darkenes shalbe hid in his secret places: the fire that is not blowen, shall deuoure him, and that which remaineth in his tabernacle, shalbe destroyed.","27":"The heauen shal declare his wickednes, & the earth shal rise vp against him.","28":"The increase of his house shal go away: it shal flow away in the day of his wrath.","29":"This is the portion of the wicked man fro God, and the heritage that he shal haue of God for his wordes."}
