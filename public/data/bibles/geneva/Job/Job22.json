{"1":"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and sayde,","2":"May a man be profitable vnto God, as he that is wise, may be profitable to himselfe?","3":"Is it any thing vnto the Almightie, that thou art righteous? or is it profitable to him, that thou makest thy wayes vpright?","4":"Is it for feare of thee that he will accuse thee? or go with thee into iudgement?","5":"Is not thy wickednes great, and thine iniquities innumerable?","6":"For thou hast taken the pledge from thy brother for nought, and spoyled the clothes of the naked.","7":"To such as were wearie, thou hast not giuen water to drinke, and hast withdrawen bread from the hungrie.","8":"But the mightie man had the earth, and he that was in autoritie, dwelt in it.","9":"Thou hast cast out widowes emptie, & the armes of the fatherles were broken.","10":"Therefore snares are round about thee, and feare shal suddenly trouble thee:","11":"Or darkenes that thou shouldest not see, & abundance of waters shal couer thee.","12":"Is not God on hie in the heauen? and behold the height of the starres how hie they are.","13":"But thou sayest, How should God know? can he iudge through the darke cloude?","14":"The cloudes hide him that he can not see, and he walketh in the circle of heauen.","15":"Hast thou marked the way of the worlde, wherein wicked men haue walked?","16":"Which were cut downe before the time, whose foundation was as a riuer that ouerflowed:","17":"Which sayd vnto God, Depart from vs, & asked what the Almightie could do for them.","18":"Yet hee filled their houses with good things: but let the counsell of the wicked be farre from me.","19":"The righteous shal see them, & shal reioyce, and the innocent shal laugh them to scorne.","20":"Surely our substance is hid: but the fire hath deuoured the remnant of them.","21":"Therefore acquaint thy selfe, I pray thee, with him, and make peace: thereby thou shalt haue prosperitie.","22":"Receiue, I pray thee, the law of his mouth, and lay vp his words in thine heart.","23":"If thou returne to the Almightie, thou shalt be buylt vp, and thou shalt put iniquitie farre from thy tabernacle.","24":"Thou shalt lay vp golde for dust, and the gold of Ophir, as the flintes of the riuers.","25":"Yea, the Almightie shalbe thy defence, and thou shalt haue plentie of siluer.","26":"And thou shalt then delite in the Almightie, and lift vp thy face vnto God.","27":"Thou shalt make thy praier vnto him, & he shal heare thee, & thou shalt render thy vowes.","28":"Thou shalt also decree a thing, and he shal establish it vnto thee, and the light shall shine vpon thy wayes.","29":"When others are cast downe, then shalt thou say, I am lifted vp: and God shall saue the humble person.","30":"The innocent shal deliuer the yland, & it shalbe preserued by the purenes of thine hands."}
