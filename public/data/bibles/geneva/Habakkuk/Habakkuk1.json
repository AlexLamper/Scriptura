{"1":"The burden, which Habakkuk the Prophet did see.","2":"O Lorde, howe long shall I crye, and thou wilt not heare! euen crye out vnto thee for violence, and thou wilt not helpe!","3":"Why doest thou shewe mee iniquitie, and cause me to beholde sorowe? for spoyling, and violence are before me: and there are that rayse vp strife and contention.","4":"Therefore the Lawe is dissolued, and iudgement doeth neuer go forth: for the wicked doeth compasse about the righteous: therefore wrong iudgement proceedeth.","5":"Beholde among the heathen, and regarde, and wonder, and maruaile: for I will worke a worke in your dayes: yee will not beleeue it, though it be tolde you.","6":"For lo, I raise vp the Caldeans, that bitter & furious nation, which shall goe vpon the breadth of the lande to possesse the dwelling places, that are not theirs.","7":"They are terrible & fearefull: their iudgement & their dignitie shal proceede of theselues.","8":"Their horses also are swifter then the leopards, and are more fierce then the wolues in the euening: and their horsemen are many: & their horsemen shall come from farre: they shall flie as the eagle hasting to meate.","9":"They come all to spoyle: before their faces shalbe an Eastwinde, and they shall gather the captiuitie, as the sand.","10":"And they shall mocke the Kings, and the princes shalbe a skorne vnto them: they shall deride euery strong holde: for they shall gather dust, and take it.","11":"Then shall they take a courage, & transgresse & doe wickedly, imputing this their power vnto their god.","12":"Art thou not of olde, O Lorde my God, mine holy one? we shall not die: O Lord, thou hast ordeined them for iudgement, and O God, thou hast established them for correction.","13":"Thou art of pure eyes, and canst not see euill: thou canst not behold wickednesse: wherefore doest thou looke vpon the transgressors, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked deuoureth the man, that is more righteous then he?","14":"And makest men as the fishes of the sea, and as the creeping things, that haue no ruler ouer them.","15":"They take vp all with the angle: they catch it in their net, and gather it in their yarne, whereof they reioyce and are glad.","16":"Therefore they sacrifice vnto their net, and burne incense vnto their yarne, because by them their portion is fat & their meat plenteous.","17":"Shall they therefore stretch out their net and not spare continually to slay the nations?"}
