{"1":"Brethren, if a man be suddenly taken in any offence, ye which are spirituall, restore such one with the spirit of meekenes, considering thy selfe, least thou also be tempted.","2":"Beare ye one anothers burden, & so fulfill the Lawe of Christ.","3":"For if any man seeme to himselfe, that he is somewhat, when he is nothing, hee deceiueth himselfe in his imagination.","4":"But let euery man prooue his owne worke: and then shal he haue reioycing in himselfe onely and not in another.","5":"For euery man shall beare his owne burden.","6":"Let him that is taught in the worde, make him that hath taught him, partaker of all his goods.","7":"Be not deceiued: God is not mocked: for whatsoeuer a man soweth, that shall hee also reape.","8":"For hee that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reape corruption: but hee that soweth to the spirit, shal of the spirit reape life euerlasting.","9":"Let vs not therefore be weary of well doing: for in due season we shall reape, if we faint not.","10":"While we haue therefore time, let vs doe good vnto all men, but specially vnto them, which are of the housholde of faith.","11":"Ye see how large a letter I haue written vnto you with mine owne hand.","12":"As many as desire to make a faire shewe in the flesh, they constraine you to be circumcised, onely because they would not suffer persecution for the crosse of Christ.","13":"For they themselues which are circumcised keepe not the law, but desire to haue you circumcised, that they might reioyce in your flesh.","14":"But God forbid that I should reioyce, but in ye crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified vnto me, & I vnto ye world.","15":"For in Christ Iesus neither circumcision auaileth any thing, nor vncircumcision, but a newe creature.","16":"And as many as walke according to this rule, peace shalbe vpon them, and mercie, and vpon the Israel of God.","17":"From henceforth let no man put me to busines: for I beare in my body the markes of the Lord Iesus.","18":"Brethren, the grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ be with your spirit, Amen. Vnto the Galatians written from Rome."}
