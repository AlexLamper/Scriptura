{"1":"Stand fast therefore in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made vs free, and be not intangled againe with the yoke of bondage.","2":"Beholde, I Paul say vnto you, that if yee be circumcised, Christ shall profite you nothing.","3":"For I testifie againe to euery man, which is circumcised, that he is bound to keepe the whole Lawe.","4":"Ye are abolished from Christ: whosoeuer are iustified by the Law, ye are fallen from grace.","5":"For we through the Spirit waite for the hope of righteousnes through faith.","6":"For in Iesus Christ neither circumcision auaileth any thing, neither vncircumcision, but faith which worketh by loue.","7":"Ye did runne well: who did let you, that ye did not obey the trueth?","8":"It is not the perswasion of him that calleth you.","9":"A litle leauen doeth leauen the whole lumpe.","10":"I haue trust in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but hee that troubleth you, shal beare his condemnation, whosoeuer he be.","11":"And brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why doe I yet suffer persecution? Then is the slaunder of the crosse abolished.","12":"Would to God they were euen cut off, which doe disquiet you.","13":"For brethren, ye haue bene called vnto libertie: onely vse not your libertie as an occasion vnto the flesh, but by loue serue one another.","14":"For all the Lawe is fulfilled in one worde, which is this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.","15":"If ye bite and deuoure one another, take heede least ye be consumed one of another.","16":"Then I say, Walke in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lustes of the flesh.","17":"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary one to another, so that ye can not doe the same things that ye would.","18":"And if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not vnder the Lawe.","19":"Moreouer the workes of the flesh are manifest, which are adulterie, fornication, vncleannes, wantonnes,","20":"Idolatrie, witchcraft, hatred, debate, emulations, wrath, contentions, seditions, heresies,","21":"Enuie, murthers, drunkennesse, gluttonie, and such like, whereof I tell you before, as I also haue tolde you before, that they which doe such things, shall not inherite the kingdome of God.","22":"But the fruite of the Spirit is loue, ioye, peace, long suffering, gentlenes, goodnes, fayth,","23":"Meekenesse, temperancie: against such there is no lawe.","24":"For they that are Christes, haue crucified the flesh with the affections and the lustes.","25":"If we liue in the Spirit, let vs also walke in the Spirit.","26":"Let vs not be desirous of vaine glorie, prouoking one another, enuying one another."}
