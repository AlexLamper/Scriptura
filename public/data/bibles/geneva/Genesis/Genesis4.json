{"1":"Afterwarde the man knewe Heuah his wife, which conceiued and bare Kain, and said, I haue obteined a man by the Lord.","2":"And againe she brought foorth his brother Habel, & Habel was a keeper of sheepe, and Kain was a tiller of the ground.","3":"And in processe of time it came to passe, that Kain brought an oblation vnto the Lorde of the fruite of the ground.","4":"And Habel also him selfe brought of the first fruites of his sheepe, and of the fat of them, and the Lorde had respect vnto Habel, and to his offering,","5":"But vnto Kain and to his offering he had no regarde: wherefore Kain was exceeding wroth, and his countenance fell downe.","6":"Then ye Lord said vnto Kain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance cast downe?","7":"If thou do well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sinne lieth at the doore: also vnto thee his desire shalbe subiect, and thou shalt rule ouer him.","8":"Then Kain spake to Habel his brother; when they were in the fielde, Kain rose vp against Habel his brother, and slewe him.","9":"Then the Lorde said vnto Kain, Where is Habel thy brother? Who answered, I cannot tell. Am I my brothers keeper?","10":"Againe he said, What hast thou done? the voyce of thy brothers blood cryeth vnto me from the earth.","11":"Now therefore thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receiue thy brothers blood from thine hand.","12":"When thou shalt till the grounde, it shall not henceforth yeelde vnto thee her strength: a vagabond and a runnagate shalt thou be in the earth.","13":"Then Kain said to the Lorde, My punishment is greater, then I can beare.","14":"Behold, thou hast cast me out this day fro the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid, and shalbe a vagabond, and a runnagate in the earth, and whosoeuer findeth me, shall slay me.","15":"Then the Lord said vnto him, Doubtlesse whosoeuer slayeth Kain, he shalbe punished seue folde; the Lord set a marke vpon Kain, lest any man finding him should kill him.","16":"Then Kain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod towarde the Eastside of Eden.","17":"Kain also knewe his wife, which conceiued and bare Henoch: and he built a citie, and called the name of the citie by ye name of his sonne, Henoch.","18":"And to Henoch was borne Irad, and Irad begate Mehuiael, and Mehuiael begate Methushael, and Methushael begate Lamech.","19":"And Lamech tooke him two wiues: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.","20":"And Adah bare Iabal, who was the father of such as dwell in the tents, and of such as haue cattell.","21":"And his brothers name was Iubal, who was the father of all that play on the harpe and organes.","22":"And Zillah also bare Tubal-kain, who wrought cunningly euery craft of brasse and of yron: and the sister of Tubal-kain was Naamah.","23":"Then Lamech saide vnto his wiues Adah and Zillah, Heare my voyce, ye wiues of Lamech: hearken vnto my speach: for I would slay a man in my wound, and a yong man in mine hurt.","24":"If Kain shalbe auenged seuen folde, truely Lamech, seuentie times seuen folde.","25":"And Adam knewe his wife againe, and she bare a sonne, and she called his name Sheth: for God, saide she, hath appointed me another seede for Habel, because Kain slewe him.","26":"And to ye same Sheth also there was borne a sonne, and he called his name Enosh. Then beganne men to call vpon the name of the Lord."}
