{"1":"Nowe Iaakob went forth on his iourney and the Angels of God met him.","2":"And when Iaakob saw them, he said, This is Gods hoste, and called the name of the same place Mahanaim.","3":"Then Iaakob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, vnto the land of Seir into the countrey of Edom:","4":"To whom he gaue commandement, saying, Thus shall ye speake to my lorde Esau: thy seruant Iaakob sayeth thus, I haue bene a stranger with Laban, and taried vnto this time.","5":"I haue beeues also and Asses, sheepe, & men seruantes, and women seruantes, and haue sent to shew my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.","6":"So ye messengers came againe to Iaakob, saying, We came vnto thy brother Esau, and hee also commeth against thee and foure hundreth men with him.","7":"Then Iaakob was greatly afraid, and was sore troubled, and deuided the people that was with him, and the sheepe, and the beeues, and the camels into two companies.","8":"For he said, If Esau come to ye one copanie and smite it, the other companie shall escape.","9":"Moreouer Iaakob said, O God of my father Abraham, & God of my father Izhak: Lord, which saydest vnto me, Returne vnto thy coutrey and to thy kinred, and I will do thee good,","10":"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and al the trueth, which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant: for with my staffe came I ouer this Iorden, & now haue I gotte two bads.","11":"I pray thee, Deliuer me from the hande of my brother, from the hande of Esau: for I feare him, least he will come and smite me, and the mother vpon the children.","12":"For thou saydest; I will surely doe thee good, and make thy seede as the sande of the sea, which can not be nombred for multitude.","13":"And he taryed there the same night, and tooke of that which came to had, a present for Esau his brother:","14":"Two hundreth shee goates & twenty hee goates, two hundreth ewes & twentie rammes:","15":"Thirtie mylche camels with their coltes, fourtie kine, and ten bullockes, twentie she asses and ten foles.","16":"So he deliuered them into the hande of his seruants, euery droue by themselues, and saide vnto his seruants, Passe before me, & put a space betweene droue and droue.","17":"And he commanded the formost, saying, If Esau my brother meete thee, and aske thee, saying, Whose seruant art thou? And whither goest thou? And whose are these before thee?","18":"Then thou shalt say, They be thy seruant Iaakobs: it is a present sent vnto my lord Esau: and beholde, he him selfe also is behinde vs.","19":"So likewise commaunded he the seconde and the thirde, and all that followed the droues, saying, After this maner, ye shall speake vnto Esau, when ye finde him.","20":"And ye shall say moreouer, Beholde, thy seruant Iaakob commeth after vs (for he thought, I will appease his wrath with the present that goeth before me, and afterwarde I will see his face: it may be that he will accept me.)","21":"So went the present before him: but he taried that night with the companie.","22":"And he rose vp the same night, and tooke his two wiues, and his two maides, and his eleuen children, and went ouer the forde Iabbok.","23":"And he tooke them, and sent them ouer the riuer, and sent ouer that he had.","24":"Now when Iaakob was left him selfe alone, there wrestled a man with him vnto the breaking of the day.","25":"And he sawe that he could not preuaile against him: therefore he touched the holowe of his thigh, and the holowe of Iaakobs thigh was loosed, as he wrestled with him.","26":"And he saide, Let me goe, for the morning appeareth. Who answered, I will not let thee go except thou blesse me.","27":"Then said he vnto him, What is thy name? And he said, Iaakob.","28":"Then said he, Thy name shalbe called Iaakob no more, but Israel: because thou hast had power with God, thou shalt also preuaile with men.","29":"Then Iaakob demaded, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name; he said, Wherefore now doest thou aske my name? & he blessed him there","30":"And Iaakob called the name of the place, Peniel: for, saide he, I haue seene God face to face, and my life is preserued.","31":"And the sunne rose vp to him as he passed Peniel, and he halted vpon his thigh.","32":"Therefore the children of Israel eate not of the sinewe that shranke in the hollowe of the thigh, vnto this day: because he touched the sinew that shranke in the holow of Iaakobs thigh."}
