{"1":"Gather your selues, euen gather you, O nation not worthie to be loued,","2":"Before the decree come foorth, and ye be as chaffe that passeth in a day, and before the fierce wrath of the Lord come vpon you, and before the day of the Lords anger come vpon you.","3":"Seeke yee the Lorde all the meeke of the earth, which haue wrought his iudgement: seeke righteousnesse, seeke lowlinesse, if so bee that ye may be hid in the day of the Lords wrath.","4":"For Azzah shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon desolate: they shall driue out Ashdod at the noone day, and Ekron shalbe rooted vp.","5":"Wo vnto the inhabitants of the sea coast. the nation of the Cherethims, the worde of the Lorde is against you: O Canaan, the lande of the Philistims, I will euen destroye thee without an inhabitant.","6":"And the sea coast shal be dwellings and cotages for shepheardes and sheepefoldes.","7":"And that coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Iudah, to feede thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shal they lodge toward night: for the Lorde their God shall visite them, and turne away their captiuitie.","8":"I haue heard the reproch of Moab, and the rebukes of the children of Ammon, whereby they vpbraided my people, and magnified themselues against their borders.","9":"Therefore, as I liue, saith the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall bee as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorah, euen the breeding of nettels and salt pittes, and a perpetuall desolation: the residue of my folke shall spoyle them, and the remnant of my people shall possesse them.","10":"This shall they haue for their pride, because they haue reproched and magnified themselues against the Lord of hostes people.","11":"The Lord will be terrible vnto them: for he wil consume all the gods of the earth, and euery man shall worship him from his place, euen all the yles of the heathen.","12":"Ye Morians also shalbe slaine by my sword with them.","13":"And he wil stretch out his hand against the North, and destroy Asshur, and will make Nineueh desolate, and waste like a wildernesse.","14":"And flockes shall lie in the middes of her, and all the beastes of the nations, and the pelicane, and the owle shall abide in the vpper postes of it: the voyce of birdes shall sing in the windowes, and desolations shalbe vpon the postes: for the cedars are vncouered.","15":"This is the reioycing citie that dwelt carelesse, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she made waste, and the lodging of the beastes! euery one that passeth by her, shall hisse and wagge his hand."}
