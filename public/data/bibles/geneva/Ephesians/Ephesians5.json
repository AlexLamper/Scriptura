{"1":"Bee yee therefore followers of God, as deare children,","2":"And walke in loue, euen as Christ hath loued vs, and hath giuen himselfe for vs, to be an offering and a sacrifice of a sweete smelling sauour to God.","3":"But fornication, and all vncleannesse, or couetousnesse, let it not be once named among you, as it becommeth Saintes,","4":"Neither filthinesse, neither foolish talking, neither iesting, which are things not comely, but rather giuing of thankes.","5":"For this ye know, that no whoremonger, neither vncleane person, nor couetous person, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Christ, and of God.","6":"Let no man deceiue you with vaine wordes: for, for such thinges commeth the wrath of God vpon the children of disobedience.","7":"Be not therefore companions with them.","8":"For ye were once darkenesse, but are nowe light in the Lord: walke as children of light,","9":"(For the fruit of the Spirit is in al goodnes, and righteousnes, and trueth)","10":"Approuing that which is pleasing to the Lorde.","11":"And haue no fellowship with ye vnfruitfull works of darknes, but euen reproue them rather.","12":"For it is shame euen to speake of the things which are done of them in secret.","13":"But all thinges when they are reproued of the light, are manifest: for it is light that maketh all things manifest.","14":"Wherefore hee sayeth, Awake thou that sleepest, and stande vp from the deade, and Christ shall giue thee light.","15":"Take heede therefore that yee walke circumspectly, not as fooles, but as wise,","16":"Redeeming ye season: for ye daies are euill.","17":"Wherefore, be ye not vnwise, but vnderstand what the will of the Lord is.","18":"And be not drunke with wine, wherein is excesse: but be fulfilled with the Spirit,","19":"Speaking vnto your selues in psalmes, and hymnes, and spirituall songs, singing, and making melodie to the Lord in your hearts,","20":"Giuing thankes alwaies for all thinges vnto God euen the Father, in the Name of our Lorde Iesus Christ,","21":"Submitting your selues one to another in the feare of God.","22":"Wiues, submit your selues vnto your husbands, as vnto the Lord.","23":"For the husband is the wiues head, euen as Christ is the head of the Church, and the same is the sauiour of his body.","24":"Therfore as the Church is in subiection to Christ, euen so let the wiues be to their husbads in euery thing.","25":"Husbands, loue your wiues, euen as Christ loued the Church, & gaue himselfe for it,","26":"That hee might sanctifie it, and clense it by the washing of water through the worde,","27":"That hee might make it vnto him selfe a glorious Church, not hauing spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it shoulde bee holy and without blame.","28":"So ought men to loue their wiues, as their owne bodies: he that loueth his wife, loueth him selfe.","29":"For no man euer yet hated his owne flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, euen as the Lord doeth the Church.","30":"For we are members of his bodie, of his flesh, and of his bones.","31":"For this cause shal a man leaue father and mother, and shall cleaue to his wife, and they twaine shalbe one flesh.","32":"This is a great secrete, but I speake concerning Christ, and concerning the Church.","33":"Therefore euery one of you, doe ye so: let euery one loue his wife, euen as himselfe, and let the wife see that shee feare her husband."}
