{"1":"And Saul consented to his death, and at that time, there was a great persecution against the Church which was at Hierusalem, and they were all scattered abroad thorowe the regions of Iudea and of Samaria, except the Apostles.","2":"Then certaine men fearing God, caried Steuen amongs them, to be buried, and made great lamentation for him.","3":"But Saul made hauocke of the Church, and entred into euery house, and drewe out both men and women, and put them into prison.","4":"Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went to and fro preaching the worde.","5":"Then came Philip into the citie of Samaria, and preached Christ vnto them.","6":"And the people gaue heed vnto those things which Philippe spake, with one accorde, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.","7":"For vncleane spirits crying with a loud voyce, came out of many that were possessed of them: and many taken with palsies, & that halted, were healed.","8":"And there was great ioy in that citie.","9":"And there was before in the citie a certaine man called Simon, which vsed witchcraft, and bewitched the people of Samaria, saying that he himselfe was some great man.","10":"To whome they gaue heede from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that great power of God.","11":"And they gaue heed vnto him, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.","12":"But assoone as they beleeued Philip, which preached the thinges that concerned the kingdome of God, and the Name of Iesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women.","13":"Then Simon himselfe beleeued also and was baptized, and continued with Philippe, and wondred, when he sawe the signes and great miracles which were done.","14":"Nowe when the Apostles, which were at Hierusalem, heard say, that Samaria had receiued the worde of God, they sent vnto them Peter and Iohn.","15":"Which whe they were come downe, prayed for them, that they might receiue the holy Ghost.","16":"(For as yet, hee was fallen downe on none of them, but they were baptized onely in the Name of the Lord Iesus.)","17":"Then layd they their handes on them, and they receiued the holy Ghost.","18":"And when Simon sawe, that through laying on of the Apostles hands the holy Ghost was giuen, he offred them money,","19":"Saying, Giue mee also this power, that on whomsoeuer I lay the handes, he may receiue the holy Ghost.","20":"Then saide Peter vnto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou thinkest that the gift of God may be obteined with money.","21":"Thou hast neither part nor fellowship in this businesse: for thine heart is not right in the sight of God.","22":"Repent therefore of this thy wickednes, and pray God, that if it be possible, the thought of thine heart may be forgiuen thee.","23":"For I see that thou art in the gall of bitternes, and in the bonde of iniquitie.","24":"Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye haue spoken, come vpon me.","25":"So they, when they had testified & preached the worde of the Lord, returned to Hierusalem, and preached the Gospel in many townes of the Samaritans.","26":"Then the Angel of the Lorde spake vnto Philip, saying, Arise, and goe towarde the South vnto the way that goeth downe from Hierusalem vnto Gaza, which is waste.","27":"And hee arose and went on: and beholde, a certaine Eunuche of Ethiopia, Candaces the Queene of the Ethiopians chiefe Gouernour, who had the rule of all her treasure, and came to Hierusalem to worship:","28":"And as he returned sitting in his charet, he read Esaias the Prophet.","29":"Then the Spirit said vnto Philip, Goe neere and ioyne thy selfe to yonder charet.","30":"And Philip ranne thither, and heard him reade the Prophet Esaias, and said, But vnderstandest thou what thou readest?","31":"And he saide, Howe can I, except I had a guide? And he desired Philip, that he would come vp and sit with him.","32":"Nowe the place of the Scripture which he read, was this, Hee was lead as a sheepe to the slaughter: and like a lambe domme before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth.","33":"In his humilitie his iudgement hath bene exalted: but who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.","34":"Then the Eunuche answered Philippe, and saide, I pray thee of whome speaketh the Prophet this? of himselfe, or of some other man?","35":"Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, & preached vnto him Iesus.","36":"And as they went on their way, they came vnto a certaine water, and the Eunuche said, See, here is water: what doeth let me to be baptized?","37":"And Philippe said vnto him, If thou beleeuest with all thine heart, thou mayest. Then he answered, and saide, I beleeue that that Iesus Christ is that Sonne of God.","38":"Then he commaunded the charet to stand stil: & they went downe both into the water, both Philip and the Eunuche, and he baptized him.","39":"And assoone as they were come vp out of the water, the Spirit of the Lorde caught away Philip, that the Eunuche sawe him no more: so he went on his way reioycing.","40":"But Philippe was found at Azotus, and he walked to and fro preaching in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea."}
