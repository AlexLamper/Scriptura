{"1":"The wordes of the Preacher, the sonne of Dauid King in Ierusalem.","2":"Vanitie of vanities, sayth the Preacher: vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie.","3":"What remaineth vnto man in all his trauaile, which he suffereth vnder ye sunne?","4":"One generation passeth, and another generation succeedeth: but the earth remaineth for euer.","5":"The sunne riseth, and ye sunne goeth downe, and draweth to his place, where he riseth.","6":"The winde goeth toward the South, and compasseth towarde the North: the winde goeth rounde about, and returneth by his circuites.","7":"All the riuers goe into the sea, yet the sea is not full: for the riuers goe vnto ye place, whence they returne, and goe.","8":"All things are full of labour: man cannot vtter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the eare filled with hearing.","9":"What is it that hath bene? That that shalbe: and what is it that hath bene done? That which shalbe done: and there is no newe thing vnder the sunne.","10":"Is there any thing, whereof one may say, Beholde this, it is newe? It hath bene already in the olde time that was before vs.","11":"There is no memorie of the former, neither shall there be a remembrance of the latter that shalbe, with them that shall come after.","12":"I the Preacher haue bene King ouer Israel in Ierusalem:","13":"And I haue giuen mine heart to search and finde out wisdome by all things that are done vnder the heauen: (this sore trauaile hath GOD giuen to the sonnes of men, to humble them thereby)","14":"I haue considered all the workes that are done vnder the sunne, and beholde, all is vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.","15":"That which is crooked, can none make straight: and that which faileth, cannot be nombred.","16":"I thought in mine heart, and said, Behold, I am become great, and excell in wisdome all them that haue bene before me in Ierusalem: and mine heart hath seene much wisedome and knowledge.","17":"And I gaue mine heart to knowe wisdome and knowledge, madnes and foolishnes: I knew also that this is a vexation of the spirit.","18":"For in the multitude of wisedome is much griefe: and he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorowe."}
