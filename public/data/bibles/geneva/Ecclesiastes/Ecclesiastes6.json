{"1":"There is an euill, which I sawe vnder the sunne, and it is much among men:","2":"A man to whom God hath giuen riches and treasures and honour, and he wanteth nothing for his soule of all that it desireth: but God giueth him not power to eate thereof, but a strange man shall eate it vp: this is vanitie, and this is an euill sicknesse.","3":"If a man beget an hundreth children and liue many yeeres, and the dayes of his yeeres be multiplied, & his soule be not satisfied with good things, and he be not buried, I say that an vntimely fruite is better then he.","4":"For he commeth into vanitie and goeth into darkenesse: and his name shall be couered with darkenesse.","5":"Also he hath not seene ye sunne, nor knowen it: therefore this hath more rest then the other.","6":"And if he had liued a thousand yeeres twise tolde, and had seene no good, shall not all goe to one place?","7":"All the labour of man is for his mouth: yet the soule is not filled.","8":"For what hath the wise man more then the foole? what hath the poore that knoweth how to walke before the liuing?","9":"The sight of ye eye is better then to walke in ye lustes: this also is vanitie, & vexation of spirit.","10":"What is that that hath bene? the name thereof is nowe named: and it is knowen that it is man: and he cannot striue with him that is stronger then he.","11":"(7:1) Svrely there be many things that increase vanitie: and what auaileth it man?","12":"(7:2) For who knoweth what is good for man in the life and in the nomber of the dayes of the life of his vanitie, seeing he maketh them as a shadowe? For who can shewe vnto man what shall be after him vnder the sunne?"}
