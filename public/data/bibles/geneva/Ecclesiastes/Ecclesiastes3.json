{"1":"To all things there is an appointed time, and a time to euery purpose vnder the heauen.","2":"A time to bee borne, and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to plucke vp that which is planted.","3":"A time to slay, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, and a time to builde.","4":"A time to weepe, and a time to laugh: a time to mourne, and a time to dance.","5":"A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones: a time to embrace, and a time to be farre from embracing.","6":"A time to seeke, and a time to lose: a time to keepe, and a time to cast away.","7":"A time to rent, and a time to sowe: a time to keepe silence, and a time to speake.","8":"A time to loue, and a time to hate: a time of warre, and a time of peace.","9":"What profite hath hee that worketh of the thing wherein he trauaileth?","10":"I haue seene the trauaile that God hath giuen to ye sonnes of men to humble them thereby.","11":"He hath made euery thing beautifull in his time: also he hath set the worlde in their heart, yet can not man finde out the worke that God hath wrought fro the beginning euen to the end.","12":"I know that there is nothing good in them, but to reioyce, and to doe good in his life.","13":"And also that euery man eateth and drinketh, and seeth the commoditie of all his labour. This is the gift of God.","14":"I knowe that whatsoeuer God shall doe, it shalbe for euer: to it can no man adde, and from it can none diminish: for God hath done it, that they should feare before him.","15":"What is that that hath bene? That is nowe: and that that shalbe, hath now bene: for God requireth that which is past.","16":"And moreouer I haue seene vnder the sunne the place of iudgement, where was wickednesse, and the place of iustice where was iniquitie.","17":"I thought in mine heart, God wil iudge the iust and the wicked: for time is there for euery purpose and for euery worke.","18":"I considered in mine heart the state of the children of men that God had purged them: yet to see to, they are in themselues as beastes.","19":"For the condition of the children of men, and the condition of beasts are euen as one condition vnto them. As the one dyeth, so dyeth the other: for they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of man aboue ye beast: for all is vanitie.","20":"All goe to one place, & all was of the dust, and all shall returne to the dust.","21":"Who knoweth whether the spirit of man ascend vpward, and the spirit of the beast descend downeward to the earth?","22":"Therefore I see that there is nothing better then that a man shoulde reioyce in his affaires, because that is his portion. For who shal bring him to see what shalbe after him?"}
