{"1":"Dead flies cause to stinke, & putrifie the ointment of the apoticarie: so doeth a litle follie him that is in estimation for wisedome, and for glorie.","2":"The heart of a wise man is at his right hand: but the heart of a foole is at his left hand.","3":"And also when the foole goeth by the way, his heart faileth, and he telleth vnto all that he is a foole.","4":"If the spirite of him that ruleth, rise vp against thee, leaue not thy place: for gentlenes pacifieth great sinnes.","5":"There is an euil that I haue seene vnder the sunne, as an error that proceedeth from the face of him that ruleth.","6":"Follie is set in great excellencie, and the riche set in the lowe place.","7":"I haue seene seruants on horses, and princes walking as seruants on the ground.","8":"He that diggeth a pit, shall fal into it, and he that breaketh the hedge, a serpent shall bite him.","9":"He that remooueth stones, shall hurt himselfe thereby, and hee that cutteth wood, shall be in danger thereby.","10":"If the yron be blunt, & one hath not whet the edge, he must then put to more strength: but the excellencie to direct a thing is wisedome.","11":"If the serpent bite, when he is not charmed: no better is a babbler.","12":"The words of ye mouth of a wise man haue grace: but the lippes of a foole deuoure himselfe.","13":"The beginning of the wordes of his mouth is foolishnesse, and the latter ende of his mouth is wicked madnesse.","14":"For the foole multiplieth woordes, saying, Man knoweth not what shall be: and who can tell him what shall be after him?","15":"The labour of the foolish doeth wearie him: for he knoweth not to goe into the citie.","16":"Woe to thee, O lande, when thy King is a childe, and thy princes eate in the morning.","17":"Blessed art thou, O land, when thy King is the sonne of nobles, and thy princes eate in time, for strength and not for drunkennesse.","18":"By slouthfulnes the roofe of the house goeth to decaie, and by the ydlenesse of the handes the house droppeth through.","19":"They prepare bread for laughter, and wine comforteth the liuing, but siluer answereth to all.","20":"Curse not the King, no not in thy thought, neither curse the rich in thy bed chamber: for the foule of the heauen shall carie the voice, & that which hath wings, shall declare the matter."}
