{"1":"So I turned and considered all the oppressions that are wrought vnder the sunne, and beholde the teares of the oppressed, and none comforteth them: and lo, the strength is of the hand of them that oppresse them, & none comforteth them.","2":"Wherefore I praysed the dead which now are dead, aboue the liuing, which are yet aliue.","3":"And I count him better then them both, which hath not yet bin: for he hath not seene the euill workes which are wrought vnder the sunne.","4":"Also I beheld all trauaile, & all perfection of workes that this is ye enuie of a man against his neighbour: this also is vanitie & vexation of spirit.","5":"The foole foldeth his hands, and eateth vp his owne flesh.","6":"Better is an handfull with quietnesse, then two handfuls with labour and vexation of spirit.","7":"Againe I returned, and sawe vanitie vnder the sunne.","8":"There is one alone, & there is not a second, which hath neither sonne nor brother, yet is there none end of all his trauaile, neither can his eye be satisfied with riches: neither doeth he thinke, For whome doe I trauaile and defraude my soule of pleasure? this also is vanitie, and this is an euill trauaile.","9":"Two are better then one: for they haue better wages for their labour.","10":"For if they fal, the one wil lift vp his felow: but wo vnto him that is alone: for he falleth, and there is not a second to lift him vp.","11":"Also if two sleepe together, then shall they haue heate: but to one how should there be heate?","12":"And if one ouercome him, two shall stand against him: and a threefolde coard is not easily broken.","13":"Better is a poore and wise childe, then an olde and foolish King, which will no more be admonished.","14":"For out of the prison he commeth forth to reigne: when as he that is borne in his kingdome, is made poore.","15":"I behelde all the liuing, which walke vnder the sunne, with the second childe, which shall stand vp in his place.","16":"There is none ende of all the people, nor of all that were before them, and they that come after, shall not reioyce in him: surely this is also vanitie and vexation of spirit."}
