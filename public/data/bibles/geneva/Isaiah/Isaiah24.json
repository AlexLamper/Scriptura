{"1":"Beholde, the Lorde maketh the earth emptie, and hee maketh it waste: hee turneth it vpside downe, and scattereth abrode the inhabitants thereof.","2":"And there shalbe like people, like Priest, and like seruaunt, like master, like maide, like mistresse, like bier, like seller, like lender, like borower, like giuer, like taker to vsurie.","3":"The earth shalbe cleane emptied, and vtterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this worde.","4":"The earth lamenteth and fadeth away: the world is feeble and decaied: the proude people of the earth are weakened.","5":"The earth also deceiueth, because of the inhabitantes thereof: for they transgressed the lawes: they changed the ordinances, and brake the euerlasting couenant.","6":"Therefore hath the curse deuoured the earth, and the inhabitantes thereof are desolate. Wherefore the inhabitants of the land are burned vp, and fewe men are left.","7":"The wine faileth, the vine hath no might: all that were of merie heart, doe mourne.","8":"The mirth of tabrets ceaseth: the noyse of them that reioyce, endeth: the ioye of the harpe ceaseth.","9":"They shall not drinke wine with mirth: strong drinke shall be bitter to them that drinke it.","10":"The citie of vanitie is broken downe: euery house is shut vp, that no man may come in.","11":"There is a crying for wine in the streetes: al ioy is darkened: the mirth of the world is gone away.","12":"In the citie is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.","13":"Surely thus shall it bee in the middes of the earth, among the people, as the shaking of an oliue tree, and as the grapes when the vintage is ended.","14":"They shall lift vp their voyce: they shall shout for the magnificence of the Lord: they shall reioyce from the sea.","15":"Wherefore praise yee the Lord in the valleis, euen the Name of the Lorde God of Israel, in the yles of the sea.","16":"From the vttermost part of the earth wee haue heard praises, euen glory to the iust, and I sayd, My leanesse, my leanesse, woe is mee: the transgressours haue offended: yea, the transgressours haue grieuously offended.","17":"Feare, and the pitte, and the snare are vpon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.","18":"And hee that fleeth from the noyse of the feare, shall fall into the pit: and he that commeth vp out of the pit, shal be taken in the snare: for the windowes from on high are open, & the foundations of the earth doe shake.","19":"The earth is vtterly broken downe: the earth is cleane dissolued: the earth is mooued exceedingly.","20":"The earth shal reele to and fro like a drunken man, and shall be remooued like a tent, and the iniquitie thereof shall be heauie vpon it: so that it shall fall, and rise no more.","21":"And in that day shall the Lorde visite the hoste aboue that is on hie, euen the Kinges of the world that are vpon the earth.","22":"And they shall be gathered together, as the prisoners in the pit: and they shal be shut vp in the prison, and after many daies shal they be visited.","23":"Then the moone shal be abashed, and the sunne ashamed, when the Lorde of hostes shall reigne in mount Zion and in Ierusalem: and glory shalbe before his ancient men."}
