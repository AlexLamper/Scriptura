{"1":"In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Iudah, We haue a strong citie: saluation shal God set for walles and bulwarkes.","2":"Open ye the gates that the righteous nation, which keepeth the trueth, may enter in.","3":"By an assured purpose wilt thou preserue perfite peace, because they trusted in thee.","4":"Trust in the Lord for euer: for in the Lord God is strength for euermore.","5":"For hee will bring downe them that dwell on hie: the hie citie he will abase: euen vnto the ground wil he cast it downe, & bring it vnto dust.","6":"The foote shall treade it downe, euen the feete of the poore, and the steppes of the needie.","7":"The way of the iust is righteousnesse: thou wilt make equall the righteous path of the iust.","8":"Also we, O Lorde, haue waited for thee in the way of thy iudgemets: the desire of our soule is to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee.","9":"With my soule haue I desired thee in the night, and with my spirit within mee will I seeke thee in the morning: for seeing thy iudgements are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learne righteousnesse.","10":"Let mercie bee shewed to the wicked, yet hee will not learne righteousnesse: in the land of vprightnesse will he do wickedly, and will not beholde the maiestie of the Lord.","11":"O Lorde, they will not beholde thine hie hande: but they shall see it, and bee confounded with the zeale of the people, and the fire of thine enemies shall deuoure them.","12":"Lord, vnto vs thou wilt ordeine peace: for thou also hast wrought all our workes for vs.","13":"O Lord our God, other lords beside thee, haue ruled vs, but we will remember thee onely, and thy Name.","14":"The dead shall not liue, neither shall the dead arise, because thou hast visited and scattered them, and destroyed all their memorie.","15":"Thou hast increased the nation, O Lord: thou hast increased the nation: thou art made glorious: thou hast enlarged all the coastes of the earth.","16":"Lorde, in trouble haue they visited thee: they powred out a prayer when thy chastening was vpon them.","17":"Like as a woman with childe, that draweth neere to the trauaile, is in sorow, and cryeth in her paines, so haue we bene in thy sight, O Lord.","18":"We haue coceiued, we haue borne in paine, as though we should haue brought forth winde: there was no helpe in the earth, neither did the inhabitants of the world fall.","19":"Thy dead men shall liue: euen with my body shall they rise. Awake, and sing, ye that dwel in dust: for thy dewe is as the dew of herbes, and the earth shall cast out the dead.","20":"Come, my people: enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doores after thee: hide thy selfe for a very litle while, vntill the indignation passe ouer.","21":"For lo, the Lord commeth out of his place, to visite the iniquitie of the inhabitants of the earth vpon them: and the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more hide her slaine."}
