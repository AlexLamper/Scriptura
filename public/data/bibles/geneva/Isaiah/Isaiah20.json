{"1":"In the yeere that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon King of Asshur sent him) and had fought against Ashdod, and taken it,","2":"At the same time spake the Lord by ye hand of Isaiah the sonne of Amoz, saying, Goe, and loose the sackecloth from thy loynes, and put off thy shooe from thy foote; he did so, walking naked and barefoote.","3":"And the Lord said, Like as my seruant Isaiah hath walked naked, & barefoote three yeeres, as a signe and wonder vpon Egypt, and Ethiopia,","4":"So shall the King of Asshur take away the captiuitie of Egypt, and the captiuitie of Ethiopia, both yong men and olde men, naked and barefoote, with their buttockes vncouered, to the shame of Egypt.","5":"And they shall feare, & be ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, & of Egypt their glory.","6":"Then shall the inhabitant of this yle say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fledde for helpe to be deliuered from the King of Asshur, and howe shall we be deliuered?"}
