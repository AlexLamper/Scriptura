Art thou become like vnto vs?","11":"Thy pompe is brought downe to ye graue, and the sounde of thy violes: the worme is spred vnder thee, and the wormes couer thee.","12":"How art thou fallen from heauen, O Lucifer, sonne of the morning? and cutte downe to the grounde, which didest cast lottes vpon the nations?","13":"Yet thou saidest in thine heart, I will ascende into heauen, and exalt my throne aboue beside the starres of God: I will sitte also vpon the mount of the Congregation in the sides of the North.","14":"I wil ascend aboue ye height of the cloudes, and I will be like the most high.","15":"But thou shalt bee brought downe to the graue, to the sides of the pit.","16":"They that see thee, shall looke vpon thee and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, and that did shake the kingdomes?","17":"He made the worlde as a wildernesse, and destroied the cities thereof, and opened not the house of his prisoners.","18":"All the Kings of the nations, euen they all sleepe in glorie, euery one in his owne house.","19":"But thou art cast out of thy graue like an abominable branch: like the raiment of those that are slaine, and thrust thorowe with a sword, which goe downe to the stones of the pit, as a carkeise troden vnder feete.","20":"Thou shalt not be ioyned with them in the graue, because thou hast destroied thine owne lande, and slaine thy people: the seede of the wicked shall not be renoumed for euer.","21":"Prepare a slaughter for his children, for the iniquitie of their fathers: let them not rise vp nor possesse the land, nor fil the face of the world with enemies.","22":"For I wil rise vp against them (sayth the Lorde of hostes) and will cut off from Babel the name and the remnant and the sonne, and the nephew, sayth the Lord:","23":"And I wil make it a possession to ye hedgehogge, and pooles of water, and I will sweepe it with the besome of destruction, sayeth the Lorde of hostes.","24":"The Lorde of hostes hath sworne, saying, Surely like as I haue purposed, so shall it come to passe, and as I haue consulted, it shall stand:","25":"That I will breake to pieces Asshur in my land, and vpon my mountaines will I treade him vnder foote: so that his yoke shall depart from them, and his burden shall be taken from off their shoulder.","26":"This is the counsell that is consulted vpon the whole worlde, and this is the hande stretched out ouer all the nations,","27":"Because the Lorde of hostes hath determined it, and who shall disanull it? and his hande is stretched out, and who shall turne it away?","28":"In the yeere that King Ahaz died, was this burden.","29":"Reioyce not, (thou whole Palestina) because the rod of him that did beat thee, is broken for out of the serpents roote shal come forth a cockatrise, & the fruit therof shalbe a firy flying serpent.","30":"For the first borne of the poore shall be fed, and the needie shall lie downe in safetie: and I will kill thy roote with famine, and it shal slay thy remnant.","31":"Howle, O gate, crie, O citie: thou whole lande of Palestina art dissolued, for there shall come from the North a smoke, and none shalbe alone, at his time appointed.","32":"What shall then one answere the messengers of the Gentiles? That the Lorde hath stablished Zion, and the poore of his people shall trust in it."}
