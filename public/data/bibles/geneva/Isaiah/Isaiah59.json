{"1":"Beholde, the Lordes hande is not shortened, that it can not saue: neither is his eare heauie, that it cannot heare.","2":"But your iniquities haue separated betweene you and your God, and your sinnes haue hidde his face from you, that he will not heare.","3":"For your handes are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquitie: your lips haue spoken lies & your tongue hath murmured iniquitie.","4":"No man calleth for iustice: no man contendeth for trueth: they trust in vanitie, & speake vaine things: they conceiue mischiefe, and bring foorth iniquitie.","5":"They hatch cockatrice egges, and weaue the spiders webbe: he that eateth of their egges, dieth, and that which is trode vpon, breaketh out into a serpent.","6":"Their webbes shall be no garment, neither shall they couer themselues with their labours: for their workes are workes of iniquitie, & the worke of crueltie is in their handes.","7":"Their feete runne to euill, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are wicked thoughts: desolation and destruction is in their paths.","8":"The way of peace they knowe not, & there is none equitie in their goings: they haue made them crooked paths: whosoeuer goeth therein, shall not knowe peace.","9":"Therefore is iudgement farre from vs, neither doeth iustice come neere vnto vs: we waite for light, but loe, it is darkenesse: for brightnesse, but we walke in darkenesse.","10":"Wee grope for the wall like the blinde, and we grope as one without eyes: we stumble at the noone day as in the twilight: we are in solitarie places, as dead men.","11":"We roare all like beares, and mourne like dooues: wee looke for equitie, but there is none: for health, but it is farre from vs.","12":"For our trespasses are many before thee, and our sinnes testifie against vs: for our trespasses are with vs, and we knowe our iniquities","13":"In trespassing and lying against the Lorde, and wee haue departed away from our God, and haue spoken of crueltie and rebellion, conceiuing and vttering out of the heart false matters.","14":"Therefore iudgement is turned backewarde, and iustice standeth farre off: for trueth is fallen in the streete, and equitie cannot enter.","15":"Yea, trueth faileth, and hee that refraineth from euill, maketh himselfe a praye: and when the Lorde sawe it, it displeased him, that there was no iudgement.","16":"And when he sawe that there was no man, hee wondered that none woulde offer him selfe. Therefore his arme did saue it, and his righteousnes it selfe did sustaine it.","17":"For he put on righteousnes, as an habergeon, and an helmet of saluation vpon his head, and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeale as a cloke.","18":"As to make recompence, as to requite the furie of the aduersaries with a recompence to his enemies: he will fully repaire the ylands.","19":"So shall they feare the Name of the Lorde from the West, and his glory from the rising of the sunne: for the enemie shall come like a flood: but the Spirit of the Lord shall chase him away.","20":"And the Redeemer shall come vnto Zion, and vnto them that turne from iniquitie in Iaakob, saith the Lord.","21":"And I will make this my couenant with them, saith the Lorde. My Spirit that is vpon thee, and my wordes, which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seede, nor out of the mouth of the seede of thy seede, saith the Lord, from hencefoorth euen for euer."}
