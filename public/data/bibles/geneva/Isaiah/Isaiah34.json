{"1":"Come neere, ye nations and heare, and hearken, ye people: let the earth heare and all that is therein, the world & al that proceedeth thereof.","2":"For the indignation of the Lord is vpon all nations, and his wrath vpon all their armies: hee hath destroyed them and deliuered them to the slaughter.","3":"And their slaine shalbe cast out, and their stincke shall come vp out of their bodies, and the mountaines shalbe melted with their blood.","4":"And all the hoste of heauen shalbe dissolued, and the heauens shall be folden like a booke: and all their hostes shall fall as the leafe falleth from the vine, and as it falleth from the figtree.","5":"For my sword shalbe drunken in the heauen: beholde, it shall come downe vpon Edom, euen vpo the people of my curse to iudgement.","6":"The sword of the Lord is filled with blood: it is made fat with the fat & with the blood of the lambes & the goates, with the fat of the kidneis of the rams: for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.","7":"And the vnicorne shall come downe with them and the heiffers with the bulles, and their lande shalbe drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatnesse.","8":"For it is the day of the Lordes vengeance, and the yeere of recompence for the iudgement of Zion.","9":"And the riuers thereof shall be turned into pitche, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shalbe burning pitch.","10":"It shal not be quenched night nor day: the smoke thereof shall goe vp euermore: it shall be desolate from generation to generation: none shall passe through it for euer.","11":"But the pelicane and the hedgehog shall possesse it, and the great owle, and the rauen shall dwel in it, and he shall stretch out vpon it the line of vanitie, and the stones of emptinesse.","12":"The nobles thereof shal call to the kingdome, and there shalbe none, and all the princes thereof shalbe as nothing.","13":"And it shall bring foorth thornes in the palaces thereof, nettles and thistles in the strong holdes thereof, and it shall be an habitation for dragons, and a court for ostriches.","14":"There shall meete also Ziim and Iim, and the Satyre shall cry to his fellow, and the shricheowle shall rest there, and shall finde for her selfe a quiet dwelling.","15":"There shall the owle make her nest, and laye, and hatche, and gather them vnder her shadowe: there shall the vultures also bee gathered, euery one with her make.","16":"Seeke in the booke of the Lord, and reade: none of these shall fayle, none shall want her make: for his mouth hath commaunded, and his very Spirit hath gathered them.","17":"And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath deuided it vnto them by line: they shal possesse it for euer: from generation to generation shall they dwell in it."}
