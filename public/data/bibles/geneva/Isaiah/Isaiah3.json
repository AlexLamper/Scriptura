{"1":"For lo, the Lord God of hostes will take away from Ierusalem and from Iudah the stay and the strength: euen all the staye of bread, and all the stay of water,","2":"The strong man, & the man of warre, the iudge and the prophet, the prudent and the aged,","3":"The captaine of fiftie, and the honourable, and the counseller, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent man.","4":"And I will appoint children to bee their princes, and babes shall rule ouer them.","5":"The people shalbe oppressed one of another, and euery one by his neighbour: the children shall presume against the ancient, and the vile against the honourable.","6":"When euery one shall take holde of his brother of the house of his father, and say, Thou hast clothing: thou shalt bee our prince, and let this fall be vnder thine hand.","7":"In that day hee shall sweare, saying, I cannot bee an helper: for there is no bread in mine house, nor clothing: therefore make me no prince of the people.","8":"Doubtlesse Ierusalem is fallen, and Iudah is fallen downe, because their tongue & workes are against the Lord, to prouoke the eyes of his glory.","9":"The triall of their countenance testifieth against them, yea, they declare their sinnes as Sodom, they hide them not. Wo be vnto their soules: for they haue rewarded euil vnto themselues.","10":"Say ye, Surely it shalbe well with the iust: for they shall eate the fruite of their workes.","11":"Woe be to the wicked, it shalbe euill with him: for the reward of his handes shalbe giuen him.","12":"Children are extorcioners of my people, and women haue rule ouer them: O my people, they that leade thee, cause thee to erre, and destroy the way of thy paths.","13":"The Lorde standeth vp to pleade, yea, hee standeth to iudge the people.","14":"The Lord shall enter into iudgement with the Ancients of his people & the princes thereof: for ye haue eaten vp the vineyarde: the spoyle of the poore is in your houses.","15":"What haue ye to do, that ye beate my people to pieces, and grinde the faces of the poore, saith the Lord, euen tho Lord of hostes?","16":"The Lord also saith, Because the daughters of Zion are hautie, and walke with stretched out neckes, and with wandering eyes, walking and minsing as they goe, and making a tinkeling with their feete,","17":"Therefore shall the Lord make the heades of the daughters of Zion balde, and the Lord shall discouer their secrete partes.","18":"In that day shall the Lorde take away the ornament of the slippers, and the calles, and the round tyres,","19":"The sweete balles, and the brasselets, and the bonnets,","20":"The tyres of the head, and the sloppes, and the head bandes, and the tablets, and the earings,","21":"The rings and the mufflers,","22":"The costly apparell and the vailes, and the wimples, and the crisping pinnes,","23":"And the glasses and the fine linen, and the hoodes, and the launes.","24":"And in steade of sweete sauour, there shall be stinke, and in steade of a girdle, a rent, and in steade of dressing of the heare, baldnesse, and in steade of a stomacher, a girding of sackecloth, and burning in steade of beautie.","25":"Thy men shall fall by the sworde, and thy strength in the battell.","26":"Then shall her gates mourne and lament, and she, being desolate, shall sit vpon the ground."}
