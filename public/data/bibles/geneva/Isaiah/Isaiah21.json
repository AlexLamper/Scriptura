{"1":"The burden of the desert Sea. As the whirlewindes in the South vse to passe from the wildernesse, so shall it come from the horrible land.","2":"A grieuous vision was shewed vnto me, The transgressour against a transgressour, and the destroyer against a destroyer. Goe vp Elam, besiege Media: I haue caused all the mourning thereof to cease.","3":"Therefore are my loynes filled with sorow: sorowes haue taken me as the sorowes of a woman that trauayleth: I was bowed downe when I heard it, and I was amased when I sawe it.","4":"Mine heart failed: fearefulnesse troubled me: the night of my pleasures hath he turned into feare vnto me.","5":"Prepare thou the table: watch in the watch towre: eate, drinke: arise, ye princes, anoynt the shielde.","6":"For thus hath the Lord said vnto me, Go, set a watchman, to tell what he seeth.","7":"And he sawe a charet with two horsemen: a charet of an asse, and a charet of a camel: and he hearkened and tooke diligent heede.","8":"And he cryed, A lyon: my lorde, I stand continually vpon ye watche towre in the day time, and I am set in my watche euery night:","9":"And beholde, this mans charet commeth with two horsemen; he answered and said, Babel is fallen: it is fallen, and all the images of her gods hath he broken vnto the ground.","10":"O my threshing, and the corne of my floore. That which I haue heard of the Lorde of hostes, the God of Israel, haue I shewed vnto you.","11":"The burden of Dumah. He calleth vnto me out of Seir, Watchman, what was in ye night? Watchman, what was in the night?","12":"The watchman saide, The morning commeth, and also the night. If yee will aske, enquire: returne and come.","13":"The burden against Arabia. In the forest of Arabia shall yee tarie all night, euen in the waies of Dedanim.","14":"O inhabitants of the lande of Tema, bring foorth water to meete the thirstie, and preuent him that fleeth with his bread.","15":"For they flee from the drawen swords, euen from the drawen sword, & from the bent bowe, and from the grieuousnesse of warre.","16":"For thus hath the Lorde sayd vnto me, Yet a yeere according to the yeeres of an hireling, and all the glorie of Kedar shall faile.","17":"And the residue of the nomber of ye strong archers of the sonnes of Kedar shall be fewe: for the Lord God of Israel hath spoken it."}
