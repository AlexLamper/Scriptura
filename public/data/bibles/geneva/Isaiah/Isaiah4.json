{"1":"And in that day shall seuen women take hold of one man, saying, Wee will eate our owne bread, and we wil weare our owne garments: onely let vs bee called by thy name, and take away our reproche.","2":"In that day shall the budde of the Lorde bee beautifull and glorious, and the fruite of the earth shalbe excellent and pleasant for them that are escaped of Israel.","3":"Then hee that shalbe left in Zion, and hee that shall remaine in Ierusalem, shalbe called holy, and euery one shalbe written among the liuing in Ierusalem,","4":"When the Lord shall wash the filthines of the daughters of Zion, and purge the blood of Ierusalem out of the middes thereof by the spirite of iudgement, and by the spirit of burning.","5":"And the Lord shal create vpon euery place of mount Zion, and vpon the assemblies thereof, a cloude and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for vpon all the glory shall be a defence.","6":"And a couering shalbe for a shadow in the day for the heate, and a place of refuge and a couert for the storme and for the raine."}
