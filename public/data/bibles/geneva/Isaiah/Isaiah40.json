{"1":"Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, will your God say.","2":"Speake comfortably to Ierusalem, and crye vnto her, that her warrefare is accomplished, that her iniquitie is pardoned: for she hath receiued of the Lords hand double for all her sinnes.","3":"A voyce cryeth in the wildernesse, Prepare ye the way of the Lord: make streight in the desert a path for our God.","4":"Euery valley shall be exalted, and euery mountaine and hill shall be made lowe: and the crooked shalbe streight, & the rough places plaine.","5":"And the glory of the Lord shalbe reueiled, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.","6":"A voyce saide, Crie; he saide, What shall I crie? All flesh is grasse, and all the grace thereof is as the floure of the fielde.","7":"The grasse withereth, the floure fadeth, because the Spirite of the Lorde bloweth vpon it: surely the people is grasse.","8":"The grasse withereth, the floure fadeth: but the worde of our God shall stand for euer.","9":"O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee vp into the hie mountaine: O Ierusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift vp thy voyce with strength: lift it vp, be not afraide: say vnto the cities of Iudah, Beholde your God.","10":"Beholde, the Lorde God will come with power, and his arme shall rule for him: beholde, his rewarde is with him, and his worke before him,","11":"He shall feede his flocke like a shepheard: he shall gather the lambes with his arme, & cary them in his bosome, and shal guide them with young.","12":"Who hath measured the waters in his fist? and counted heauen with the spanne, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure? and weighed ye mountaines in a weight, and the hilles in a balance?","13":"Who hath instructed ye Spirit of the Lord? or was his counseler or taught him?","14":"Of whom tooke he counsell, and who instructed him and taught him in the way of iudgement? or taught him knowledge, and shewed vnto him the way of vnderstanding?","15":"Beholde, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the dust of the balance: beholde, he taketh away the yles as a litle dust.","16":"And Lebanon is not sufficient for fire, nor the beastes thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.","17":"All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him, lesse then nothing, and vanitie.","18":"To whom then wil ye liken God? or what similitude will ye set vp vnto him?","19":"The workeman melteth an image, or the goldsmith beateth it out in golde, or the goldesmith maketh siluer plates.","20":"Doeth not the poore chuse out a tree that will not rot, for an oblation? he seeketh also vnto him a cunning workeman, to prepare an image, that shall not be moued.","21":"Know ye nothing? haue ye not heard it? hath it not bene tolde you from the beginning? haue ye not vnderstand it by the foundation of the earth?","22":"He sitteth vpon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grashoppers, hee stretcheth out ye heauens, as a curtaine, and spreadeth them out, as a tent to dwell in.","23":"He bringeth the princes to nothing, and maketh the iudges of the earth, as vanitie,","24":"As though they were not plated, as though they were not sowen, as though their stocke tooke no roote in the earth: for he did euen blow vpon them, and they withered, and the whirlewinde will take them away as stubble.","25":"To whom nowe will ye liken me, that I should be like him, saith the Holy one?","26":"Lift vp your eyes on hie, and beholde who hath created these things, and bringeth out their armies by nomber, and calleth them all by names? by the greatnesse of his power & mightie strength nothing faileth.","27":"Why sayest thou, O Iaakob, and speakest O Israel, My way is hid from the Lorde, and my iudgement is passed ouer of my God?","28":"Knowest thou not? or hast thou not heard, that the euerlasting God, the Lorde hath created the endes of the earth? he neither fainteth, nor is wearie: there is no searching of his vnderstanding.","29":"But he giueth strength vnto him that fainteth, and vnto him that hath no strength, he encreaseth power.","30":"Euen the yong men shall faint, and be wearie, and the yong men shall stumble and fall.","31":"But they that waite vpon the Lord, shall renue their strength: they shall lift vp the wings as the eagles: they shall runne, and not be wearie, and they shall walke and not faint."}
