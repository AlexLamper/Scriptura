{"1":"Arise, arise: put on thy strength, O Zion: put on thy garments of thy beautie, O Ierusalem, the holy citie: for hencefoorth there shall no more come into thee the vncircumcised and the vncleane.","2":"Shake thy selfe from the dust: arise, and sit downe, O Ierusalem: loose the bandes of thy necke, O thou captiue daughter, Zion.","3":"For thus sayeth the Lorde, Yee were solde for naught: therefore shall ye be redeemed without money.","4":"For thus saith the Lorde God, My people went downe afore time into Egypt to soiourne there, and Asshur oppressed them without cause.","5":"Nowe therefore what haue I here, saith the Lorde, that my people is taken away for naught, & they that rule ouer them, make them to howle, saith the Lorde? And my Name all the day continually is blasphemed?","6":"Therefore my people shal know my Name: therefore they shall know in that day, that I am he that doe speake: beholde, it is I.","7":"How beautifull vpon the mountaines are the feete of him, that declareth and publisheth peace? That declareth good tidings, and publisheth saluation, saying vnto Zion, Thy God reigneth?","8":"The voyce of thy watchmen shalbe heard: they shall lift vp their voyce, and shoute together: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring againe Zion.","9":"O ye desolate places of Ierusalem, bee glad and reioyce together: for the Lorde hath comforted his people: he hath redeemed Ierusalem.","10":"The Lorde hath made bare his holy arme in the sight of all the Gentiles, and all the endes of the earth shall see the saluation of our God.","11":"Depart, depart ye: goe out from thence and touche no vncleane thing: goe out of the middes of her: be ye cleane, that beare the vessels of the Lord.","12":"For ye shall not goe out with haste, nor depart by fleeing away: but the Lorde will goe before you, and the God of Israel will gather you together.","13":"Beholde, my seruant shall prosper: he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very hie.","14":"As many were astonied at thee (his visage was so deformed of men, and his forme of the sonnes of men)","15":"so shall hee sprinkle many nations: the Kings shall shut their mouthes at him: for that which had not bene tolde them, shall they see, and that which they had not heard, shall they vnderstande."}
