{"1":"I haue bene sought of them that asked not: I was found of them that sought me not: I sayd, Beholde me, beholde me, vnto a nation that called not vpon my Name.","2":"I haue spred out mine handes all the day vnto a rebellious people, which walked in a way that was not good, euen after their owne imaginations:","3":"A people that prouoked me euer vnto my face: that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense vpon brickes.","4":"Which remaine among the graues, and lodge in the desarts, which eate swines flesh, and the broth of things polluted are in their vessels.","5":"Which say, Stand apart, come not nere to me: for I am holier then thou: these are a smoke in my wrath & a fire that burneth all the day.","6":"Beholde, it is written before me: I wil not keepe silence, but will render it and recompense it into their bosome.","7":"Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers shalbe together (sayth the Lorde) which haue burnt incense vpon the mountaines, & blasphemed me vpon the hilles: therefore wil I measure their olde worke into their bosome.","8":"Thus sayth the Lord, As the wine is found in the cluster, and one sayth, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it, so will I doe for my seruants sakes, that I may not destroy them whole.","9":"But I will bring a seede out of Iaakob, and out of Iudah, that shal inherit my mountaine: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my seruants shall dwell there.","10":"And Sharon shalbe a sheepefolde, and the valley of Achor shalbe a resting place for the cattell of my people, that haue sought me.","11":"But ye are they that haue forsaken the Lord and forgotten mine holy Mountaine, and haue prepared a table for the multitude, and furnish the drinke offerings vnto the number.","12":"Therefore wil I number you to the sword, and all you shal bowe downe to the slaughter, because I called, and ye did not answere: I spake, and ye heard not, but did euil in my sight, and did chuse that thing which I would not.","13":"Therefore thus saith the Lorde God, Beholde, my seruants shal eate, and ye shalbe hungrie: beholde, my seruants shal drinke, and ye shal be thirstie: beholde, my seruants shal reioyce, and ye shalbe ashamed.","14":"Beholde, my seruants shal sing for ioye of heart, and ye shal crye for sorow of heart, and shal howle for vexation of minde.","15":"And ye shal leaue your name as a curse vnto my chosen: for the Lord God shall slay you and call his seruants by another name.","16":"He that shal blesse in the earth, shal blesse himselfe in the true God, and he that sweareth in the earth, shall sweare by the true God: for the former troubles are forgotten, and shall surely hide themselues from mine eyes.","17":"For lo, I will create newe heauens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembred nor come into minde.","18":"But be you glad and reioyce for euer in the things that I shall create: for beholde, I will create Ierusalem, as a reioycing and her people as a ioye,","19":"And I wil reioyce in Ierusalem, and ioye in my people, and the voyce of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voyce of crying.","20":"There shall be no more there a childe of yeeres, nor an olde man that hath not filled his dayes: for he that shall be an hundreth yeeres old, shall dye as a yong man: but the sinner being an hundreth yeeres olde shall be accursed.","21":"And they shall build houses and inhabite them, and they shall plant vineyards, and eate the fruite of them.","22":"They shall not build, and another inhabite: they shall not plant, and another eate: for as the dayes of the tree are the dayes of my people, and mine elect shall inioye in olde age the worke of their handes.","23":"They shall not labour in vaine, nor bring forth in feare: for they are the seede of the blessed of the Lord, and their buds with them.","24":"Yea, before they call, I will answere, and whiles they speake, I will heare.","25":"The wolfe and the lambe shall feede together, and the lyon shall eate strawe like the bullocke: and to the serpent dust shall be his meate. They shall no more hurt nor destroy in all mine holy Mountaine, saith the Lord."}
