{"1":"For Zions sake I will not holde my tongue, and for Ierusalems sake I wil not rest, vntil the righteousnes thereof breake foorth as the light, and saluation thereof as a burning lampe.","2":"And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousnesse, and all Kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shal name.","3":"Thou shalt also be a crowne of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royall diademe in the hand of thy God.","4":"It shall no more be sayd vnto thee, Forsaken, neither shal it be said any more to thy land, Desolate, but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the Lorde deliteth in thee, and thy land shall haue an husband.","5":"For as a yong man marieth a virgine, so shall thy sonnes marry thee: and as a bridegrome is glad of the bride, so shall thy God reioyce ouer thee.","6":"I haue set watchmen vpon thy walles, O Ierusalem, which all the day & all the night continually shal not cease: ye that are mindfull of the Lord, keepe not silence,","7":"And giue him no rest, till hee repaire and vntill hee set vp Ierusalem the prayse of the worlde.","8":"The Lorde hath sworne by his right hand and by his strong arme, Surely I wil no more giue thy corne to be meate for thine enemies, & surely the sonnes of the strangers shall not drinke thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured.","9":"But they that haue gathered it, shall eate it, and prayse the Lorde, and the gatherers thereof shal drinke it in the courtes of my Sanctuarie.","10":"Go through, go through the gates: prepare you the way for the people: cast vp, cast vp the way, and gather out the stones and set vp a standart for the people.","11":"Beholde, the Lorde hath proclaimed vnto the endes of the world: tell the daughter Zion, Beholde, thy Sauiour commeth: beholde, his wages is with him, and his worke is before him.","12":"And they shal call them, The holy people, the redeemed of the Lord, and thou shalt be named, A citie sought out and not forsaken."}
