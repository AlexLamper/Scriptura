{"1":"And I sawe another mightie Angel come downe from heauen, clothed with a cloude, and the raine bowe vpon his head, and his face was as the sunne, and his feete as pillars of fire.","2":"And hee had in his hande a litle booke open, and he put his right foote vpon the sea, and his left on the earth,","3":"And cried with a loude voyce, as when a lyon roareth: and when he had cried, seuen thunders vttered their voyces.","4":"And whe the seuen thunders had vttered their voyces, I was about to write: but I heard a voice fro heauen saying vnto me, Seale vp those things which the seuen thunders haue spoken, and write them not.","5":"And the Angel which I sawe stand vpon the sea, and vpon the earth, lift vp his hand to heauen,","6":"And sware by him that liueth for euermore, which created heauen, and the thinges that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the thinges that therein are, that time should be no more.","7":"But in the dayes of the voyce of the seuenth Angel, when he shall beginne to blow the trumpet, euen the mysterie of God shalbe finished, as he hath declared to his seruants the Prophets.","8":"And the voyce which I heard from heauen, spake vnto me againe, and said, Go and take the litle booke which is open in the hand of the Angel, which standeth vpon the sea and vpon the earth.","9":"So I went vnto the Angel, and saide to him, Giue me the litle booke; he said vnto me, Take it, and eate it vp, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shalbe in thy mouth as sweete as honie.","10":"Then I tooke the litle booke out of ye Angels hand, and ate it vp, and it was in my mouth as sweete as hony: but whe I had eaten it my belly was bitter.","11":"And he said vnto me, Thou must prophecie againe among the people and nations, and tongues, and to many Kings."}
