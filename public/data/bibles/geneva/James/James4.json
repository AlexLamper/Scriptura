{"1":"From whence are warres and contentions among you? are they not hence, euen of your pleasures, that fight in your members?","2":"Ye lust, and haue not: ye enuie, and desire immoderately, and cannot obtaine: ye fight and warre, and get nothing, because ye aske not.","3":"Ye aske, and receiue not, because ye aske amisse, that ye might lay the same out on your pleasures.","4":"Ye adulterers and adulteresses, knowe ye not that the amitie of the world is the enimitie of God? Whosoeuer therefore will be a friend of the world, maketh himselfe the enemie of God.","5":"Doe ye thinke that the Scripture sayeth in vaine, The spirit that dwelleth in vs, lusteth after enuie?","6":"But the Scripture offereth more grace, and therefore sayth, God resisteth the proude, and giueth grace to the humble.","7":"Submit your selues to God: resist the deuill, and he will flee from you.","8":"Drawe neere to God, and he will drawe nere to you. Clense your handes, ye sinners, and purge your hearts, ye double minded.","9":"Suffer afflictions, and sorrowe ye, and weepe: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your ioy into heauinesse.","10":"Cast downe your selues before the Lord, and he will lift you vp.","11":"Speake not euill one of another, brethren. He that speaketh euill of his brother, or he that condemneth his brother, speaketh euill of ye Law, and condemneth the Lawe: and if thou condemnest the Lawe, thou art not an obseruer of the Lawe, but a iudge.","12":"There is one Lawgiuer, which is able to saue, and to destroy. Who art thou that iudgest another man?","13":"Goe to now ye that say, To day or to morowe we will goe into such a citie, and continue there a yeere, and bye and sell, and get gaine,","14":"(And yet ye cannot tell what shalbe to morowe. For what is your life? It is euen a vapour that appeareth for a litle time, and afterward vanisheth away)","15":"For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, and, if we liue, we will doe this or that.","16":"But nowe ye reioyce in your boastings: all such reioycing is euill.","17":"Therefore, to him that knoweth howe to doe well, and doeth it not, to him it is sinne."}
