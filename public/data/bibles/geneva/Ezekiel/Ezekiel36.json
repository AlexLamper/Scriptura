{"1":"Also thou sonne of man, prophesie vnto the mountaines of Israel, & say, Ye mountaines of Israel, heare the word of the Lord.","2":"Thus saith the Lord God, because the enemie hath sayde against you, Aha, euen the hye places of the world are ours in possession,","3":"Therefore prophesie, & say, Thus sayth the Lord God, Because that they haue made you desolate, & swallowed you vp on euery side, that ye might be a possession vnto the residue of the heathen, & ye are come vnto the lippes & tongues of men, and vnto the reproch of the people,","4":"Therefore ye mountaines of Israel, heare the worde of the Lord God, Thus sayth the Lord God to the mountaines & to the hilles, to the riuers, and to the valleys, and to the waste, and desolate places, and to the cities that are forsaken: which are spoyled & had in derision of the residue of the heathen that are round about.","5":"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Surely in the fire of mine indignation haue I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which haue taken my lande for their possession, with the ioy of all their heart, and with despitefull mindes to cast it out for a pray.","6":"Prophesie therfore vpon the land of Israel, and say vnto the mountaines, and to the hilles, to the riuers, & to the valleys, Thus sayth the Lorde God, Behold, I haue spoken in mine indignation, and in my wrath, because yee haue suffered the shame of the heathen,","7":"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, I haue lifted vp mine hand, surely the heathen that are about you, shal beare their shame.","8":"But you, O mountaines of Israel, yee shall shoote forth your branches, and bring foorth your fruite to my people of Israel: for they are ready to come.","9":"For behold, I come vnto you, & I wil turne vnto you, and ye shalbe tilled and sowen.","10":"And I wil multiply the men vpon you, euen all the house of Israel wholly, & the cities shalbe inhabited, & the desolate places shalbe builded.","11":"And I wil multiply vpon you man & beast, and they shal encrease, and bring fruite, and I will cause you to dwell after your olde estate, & I will bestowe benefites vpon you more then at the first, and ye shal know that I am the Lord.","12":"Yea, I wil cause men to walke vpon you, euen my people Israel, and they shall possesse you, and ye shalbe their inheritance, and ye shal no more henceforth depriue them of men.","13":"Thus sayth the Lord God, because they say vnto you, Thou land deuourest vp men, & hast bene a waster of thy people,","14":"Therefore thou shalt deuoure men no more, neither waste thy people henceforth, sayth the Lord God,","15":"Neither will I cause men to heare in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou beare the reproche of the people any more, neither shalt cause thy folke to fal any more, saith the Lord God.","16":"Moreouer the word of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,","17":"Sonne of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their owne lande, they defiled it by their owne wayes, & by their deedes: their way was before me as the filthinesse of the menstruous.","18":"Wherfore I powred my wrath vpon them, for the blood that they had shed in the land, and for their idoles, wherewith they had polluted it.","19":"And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries for according to their wayes, and according to their deedes, I iudged them.","20":"And when they entred vnto the heathen, whither they went, they polluted mine holy Name, when they sayd of them, These are the people of the Lord, and are gone out of his land.","21":"But I fauoured mine holy Name which the house of Israel had polluted among the heathen, whither they went.","22":"Therfore say vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith ye Lord God, I doe not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy Names sake, which yee polluted among the heathen whither ye went.","23":"And I wil sanctifie my great Name, which was polluted among the heathen, among whome you haue polluted it, and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, sayth the Lorde God, when I shalbe sanctified in you before their eyes.","24":"For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your owne land.","25":"Then wil I powre cleane water vpon you, and ye shalbe cleane: yea, from all your filthines, and from all your idoles wil I clense you.","26":"A newe heart also will I giue you, and a new spirit wil I put within you, and I will take away the stonie heart out of your body, and I will giue you an heart of flesh.","27":"And I will put my spirite within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes, and ye shall keepe my iudgements and do them.","28":"And ye shall dwell in the land, that I gaue to your fathers, and ye shalbe my people, & I will be your God.","29":"I will also deliuer you from all your filthinesse, and I will call for corne, and will increase it, and lay no famine vpon you.","30":"For I will multiplie the fruite of the trees, & the increase of the fielde, that ye shal beare no more the reproch of famine among the heathen.","31":"Then shal ye remember your owne wicked wayes, & your deedes that were not good, & shal iudge your selues worthie to haue bene destroyed for your iniquities, and for your abominations.","32":"Be it knowen vnto you that I do not this for your sakes, sayth the Lord God: therefore, O ye house of Israel, be ashamed, and confounded for your owne wayes.","33":"Thus sayth the Lord God, What time as I shall haue clensed you from all your iniquities, I will cause you to dwel in the cities, & the desolate places shalbe builded.","34":"And the desolate land shalbe tilled, whereas it lay waste in the sight of all that passed by.","35":"For they sayd, This waste land was like the garden of Eden, and these waste & desolate and ruinous cities were strong, and were inhabited.","36":"Then the residue of the heathen that are left round about you, shal know that I the Lord builde the ruinous places, and plant the desolate places: I the Lord haue spoken it, and wil do it.","37":"Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be sought of ye house of Israel, to performe it vnto them: I wil encrease them with men like a flocke.","38":"As the holy flocke, as the flocke of Ierusalem in their solemne feastes, so shall the desolate cities be filled with flockes of men, and they shal know, that I am the Lord."}
