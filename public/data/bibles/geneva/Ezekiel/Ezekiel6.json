{"1":"Againe the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,","2":"Sonne of man, Set thy face towardes the mountaines of Israel, and prophecie against them,","3":"And say, Ye mountaines of Israel, heare the worde of the Lorde God: thus sayth the Lorde God to the mountaines and to the hilles, to the riuers and to the valleis, Beholde, I, euen I will bring a sworde vpon you, and I will destroy your hie places:","4":"And your altars shalbe desolate, and your images of the sunne shalbe broken: and I will cast downe your slaine men before your idoles.","5":"And I will lay the dead carkeises of the children of Israel before their idoles, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.","6":"In all your dwelling places the cities shalbe desolate, and the hie places shalbe laide waste, so that your altars shalbe made waste and desolate, and your idoles shalbe broken, and cease, & your images of the sunne shalbe cut in pieces, & your workes shalbe abolished.","7":"And the slaine shall fall in the middes of you, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lorde.","8":"Yet will I leaue a remnant, that you may haue some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when you shalbe scattred through the countreyes.","9":"And they that escape of you, shall remember me among the nations, where they shalbe in captiuitie, because I am grieued for their whorish hearts, which haue departed from mee, and for their eyes, which haue gone a whoring after their idoles, and they shalbe displeased in them selues for the euils, which they haue committed in all their abominations.","10":"And they shall knowe that I am the Lord, and that I haue not saide in vaine, that I woulde doe this euill vnto them.","11":"Thus saith the Lorde God, Smite with thine hand, & stretch forth with thy foote, and say, Alas, for all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel: for they shall fall by the sworde, by the famine, and by the pestilence.","12":"He that is farre off, shal dye of the pestilence, and he that is neere, shal fall by the sword, and hee that remaineth and is besieged, shal dye by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath vpon them.","13":"Then ye shall knowe, that I am ye Lorde, when their slaine men shalbe among their idoles round about their altars, vpon euerie hie hill in al the toppes of the mountaines, and vnder euery greene tree, and vnder euerie thicke oke, which is the place where they did offer sweete sauour to all their idoles.","14":"So will I stretch mine hand vpon them, and make the lande waste, and desolate from the wildernes vnto Diblath in all their habitations, and they shall know, that I am the Lorde."}
