{"1":"Againe in the ninth yeere, in the tenth moneth, in the tenth day of the moneth, came the worde of the Lord vnto me, saying,","2":"Sonne of man, write thee the name of the day, euen of this same day: for the King of Babel set himselfe against Ierusalem this same day.","3":"Therefore speake a parable vnto the rebellious house, and say vnto them, Thus sayth the Lorde God, Prepare a pot, prepare it, and also powre water into it.","4":"Gather the pieces thereof into it, euen euery good piece, as the thigh and the shoulder, and fill it with the chiefe bones.","5":"Take one of the best sheepe, and burne also the bones vnder it, and make it boyle well, and seethe the bones of it therein,","6":"Because the Lorde God sayth thus, Woe to the bloody citie, euen to the pot, whose skomme is therein, & whose skomme is not gone out of it: bring it out piece by piece: let no lot fall vpon it.","7":"For her blood is in the middes of her: shee set it vpon an high rocke, and powred it not vpon on the ground to couer it with dust,","8":"That it might cause wrath to arise, & take vengeance: euen I haue set her blood vpon an high rocke that it should not be couered.","9":"Therefore thus saith ye Lord God, Woe to the bloody citie, for I will make ye burning great.","10":"Heape on much wood: kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and cast in spice, and let the bones be burnt.","11":"Then set it emptie vpon the coles thereof, that the brasse of it may be hot, and may burne, and that the filthinesse of it may be molten in it, and that the skomme of it may be consumed.","12":"She hath wearied her selfe with lyes, and her great skomme went not out of her: therefore her skomme shall be consumed with fire.","13":"Thou remainest in thy filthines and wickednes: because I would haue purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthines, till I haue caused my wrath to light vpon thee.","14":"I the Lord haue spoken it: it shall come to passe, and I will doe it: I will not goe backe, neither will I spare, neither will I repent: according to thy wayes, & according to thy workes shall they iudge thee, sayeth the Lord God.","15":"Also the worde of ye Lord came vnto me, saying,","16":"Sonne of man beholde, I take away from thee the pleasure of thine eyes with a plague: yet shalt thou neither mourne nor weepe, neither shal thy teares runne downe.","17":"Cease from sighing: make no mourning for the dead, and binde the tyre of thine head vpon thee, and put on thy shooes vpon thy feete, and couer not thy lips, and eate not the bread of men.","18":"So I spake vnto the people in the morning, and at euen my wife dyed: and I did in the morning, as I was commanded.","19":"And the people said vnto me, Wilt thou not tell vs what these things meane towarde vs that thou doest so?","20":"Then I answered them, The worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,","21":"Speake vnto the house of Israel, Thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I will pollute my Sanctuarie, euen the pride of your power, the pleasure of your eyes, and your hearts desire, and your sonnes, and your daughters whom ye haue left, shall fall by the sworde.","22":"And ye shall doe as I haue done: ye shall not couer your lippes, neither shall ye eate the bread of men.","23":"And your tyre shalbe vpon your heads, and your shooes vpon your feete: ye shall not mourne nor weepe, but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourne one toward another.","24":"Thus Ezekiel is vnto you a signe: according to all that he hath done, ye shall do: and when this commeth, ye shall know that I am the Lord God.","25":"Also, thou sonne of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their power, ye ioy of their honor, ye pleasure of their eyes, & the desire of their heart, their sonnes & their daughters?","26":"That he that escapeth in that day, shal come vnto thee to tell thee that which hee hath heard with his eares?","27":"In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speake, and be no more dumme, & thou shalt be a signe vnto them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord."}
