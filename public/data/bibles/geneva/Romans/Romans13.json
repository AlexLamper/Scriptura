{"1":"Let euery soule be subiect vnto the higher powers: for there is no power but of God: and the powers that be, are ordeined of God.","2":"Whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist, shall receiue to themselues condemnation.","3":"For Magistrates are not to be feared for good workes, but for euill. Wilt thou then bee without feare of the power? doe well: so shalt thou haue praise of the same.","4":"For he is ye minister of God for thy wealth, but if thou do euill, feare: for he beareth not the sworde for nought: for he is the minister of God to take vengeance on him that doeth euill.","5":"Wherefore ye must bee subiect, not because of wrath only, but also for conscience sake.","6":"For, for this cause ye pay also tribute: for they are Gods ministers, applying themselues for the same thing.","7":"Giue to all men therefore their duetie: tribute, to whome yee owe tribute: custome, to whom custome: feare, to whome feare: honour, to whom ye owe honour.","8":"Owe nothing to any man, but to loue one another: for he that loueth another, hath fulfilled the Lawe.","9":"For this, Thou shalt not commit adulterie, Thou shalt not kil, Thou shalt not steale, Thou shalt not beare false witnes, Thou shalt not couet: and if there be any other commaundement, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, euen in this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.","10":"Loue doeth not euill to his neighbour: therefore is loue the fulfilling of the Lawe.","11":"And that, considering the season, that it is now time that we should arise fro sleepe: for now is our saluation neerer, then when we beleeued it.","12":"The night is past, and the day is at hande, let vs therefore cast away the workes of darkenesse, and let vs put on the armour of light,","13":"So that wee walke honestly, as in the day: not in gluttonie, and drunkennesse, neither in chambering and wantonnes, nor in strife and enuying.","14":"But put yee on the Lorde Iesvs Christ, and take no thought for the flesh, to fulfill the lustes of it."}
