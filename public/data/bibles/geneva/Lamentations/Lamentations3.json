{"1":"I am the man, that hath seene affliction in the rod of his indignation.","2":"He hath ledde mee, and brought me into darkenes, but not to light.","3":"Surely he is turned against me: he turneth his hand against me all the day.","4":"My flesh and my skinne hath he caused to waxe olde, and he hath broken my bones.","5":"He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall, and labour.","6":"He hath set me in darke places, as they that be dead for euer.","7":"He hath hedged about mee, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chaines heauy.","8":"Also when I cry and showte, hee shutteth out my prayer.","9":"He hath stopped vp my wayes with hewen stone, and turned away my paths.","10":"He was vnto me as a beare lying in waite, and as a Lion in secret places.","11":"He hath stopped my wayes, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.","12":"He hath bent his bow & made me a marke for the arrow.","13":"Hee caused the arrowes of his quiuer to enter into my reines.","14":"I was a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.","15":"He hath filled me with bitternes, & made me drunken with wormewood.","16":"He hath also broken my teeth with stones, and hath couered me with ashes.","17":"Thus my soule was farre off from peace: I forgate prosperitie,","18":"And I saide, My strength & mine hope is perished from the Lord,","19":"Remembring mine affliction, & my mourning, the wormewood and the gall.","20":"My soule hath them in remembrance, and is humbled in me.","21":"I consider this in mine heart: therefore haue I hope.","22":"It is the Lordes mercies that wee are not consumed, because his compassions faile not.","23":"They are renued euery morning: great is thy faithfulnesse.","24":"The Lorde is my portion, sayth my soule: therefore wil I hope in him.","25":"The Lord is good vnto them, that trust in him, and to the soule that seeketh him.","26":"It is good both to trust, and to waite for the saluation of the Lord.","27":"It is good for a man that he beare the yoke in his youth.","28":"He sitteth alone, and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it vpon him.","29":"He putteth his mouth in the dust, if there may be hope.","30":"Hee giueth his cheeke to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproches.","31":"For the Lord will not forsake for euer.","32":"But though he sende affliction, yet will he haue compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.","33":"For he doeth not punish willingly, nor afflict the children of men,","34":"In stamping vnder his feete all the prisoners of the earth,","35":"In ouerthrowing the right of a man before the face of the most high,","36":"In subuerting a man in his cause: the Lord seeth it not.","37":"Who is he then that sayth, & it commeth to passe, and the Lord commandeth it not?","38":"Out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth not euill and good?","39":"Wherefore then is the liuing man sorowfull? man suffreth for his sinne.","40":"Let vs search and try our wayes, and turne againe to the Lord.","41":"Let vs lift vp our hearts with our handes vnto God in the heauens.","42":"We haue sinned, and haue rebelled, therefore thou hast not spared.","43":"Thou hast couered vs with wrath, and persecuted vs: thou hast slaine and not spared.","44":"Thou hast couered thy selfe with a cloude, that our prayer should not passe through.","45":"Thou hast made vs as the ofscouring and refuse in the middes of the people.","46":"All our enemies haue opened their mouth against vs.","47":"Feare, and a snare is come vpon vs with desolation and destruction.","48":"Mine eye casteth out riuers of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.","49":"Mine eye droppeth without stay and ceaseth not,","50":"Till the Lorde looke downe, and beholde from heauen.","51":"Mine eye breaketh mine heart because of all the daughters of my citie.","52":"Mine enemies chased me sore like a birde, without cause.","53":"They haue shut vp my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone vpon me.","54":"Waters flowed ouer mine head, then thought I, I am destroyed.","55":"I called vpon thy Name, O Lorde, out of the lowe dungeon.","56":"Thou hast heard my voyce: stoppe not thine eare from my sigh and from my cry.","57":"Thou drewest neere in the day that I called vpon thee: thou saydest, Feare not.","58":"O Lord, thou hast maintained the cause of my soule, and hast redeemed my life.","59":"O Lorde, thou hast seene my wrong, iudge thou my cause.","60":"Thou hast seene all their vengeance, and all their deuises against me.","61":"Thou hast heard their reproch, O Lord, and all their imaginations against me:","62":"The lippes also of those that rose against me, and their whispering against me continually.","63":"Behold, their sitting downe and their rising vp, how I am their song.","64":"Giue them a recompence, O Lord, according to the worke of their handes.","65":"Giue them sorow of heart, euen thy curse to them.","66":"Persecute with wrath & destroy them from vnder the heauen, O Lord."}
