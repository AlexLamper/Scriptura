{"1":"After the death of Saul, when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites and had beene two dayes in Ziklag,","2":"Behold, a man came the third day out of the host from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth vpon his head: and when hee came to Dauid, he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.","3":"Then Dauid saide vnto him, Whence commest thou? And he said vnto him, Out of the host of Israel I am escaped.","4":"And Dauid saide vnto him, What is done? I pray thee, tell me. Then he said, that the people is fled from the battel, and many of the people are ouerthrowen, and dead, & also Saul and Ionathan his sonne are dead.","5":"And Dauid saide vnto the yong man that tolde it him, Howe knowest thou that Saul and Ionathan his sonne be dead?","6":"Then the yong man that tolde him, answered, As I came to mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned vpon his speare, and loe, the charets and horsemen followed hard after him.","7":"And when he looked backe, he saw me, and called me; I answered, Here am I.","8":"And he said vnto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.","9":"Then saide hee vnto me, I pray thee come vpon mee, and slay me: for anguish is come vpon me, because my life is yet whole in me.","10":"So I came vpon him, and slewe him, and because I was sure that hee coulde not liue, after that hee had fallen, I tooke the crowne that was vpon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arme, and brought them hither vnto my lord.","11":"Then Dauid tooke hold on his clothes, & rent them, and likewise al the men that were with him.","12":"And they mourned and wept, and fasted vntil euen, for Saul and for Ionathan his sonne, & for the people of the Lorde, and for the house of Israel, because they were slaine with the sword.","13":"Afterward Dauid saide vnto the yong man that tolde it him, Whence art thou? And hee answered, I am the sonne of a stranger an Amalekite.","14":"And Dauid said vnto him, How wast thou not afrayd, to put forth thine hand to destroy the Anoynted of the Lord?","15":"Then Dauid called one of his yong men, and said, Goe neere, and fall vpon him; hee smote him that he dyed.","16":"Then said Dauid vnto him, Thy blood be vpon thine owne head: for thine owne mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I haue slaine the Lords Anoynted.","17":"Then Dauid mourned with this lamentation ouer Saul, and ouer Ionathan his sonne,","18":"(Also he bade them teach the children of Iudah to shoote, as it is written in the booke of Iasher)","19":"O noble Israel, hee is slane vpon thy hie places: how are the mightie ouerthrowen!","20":"Tell it not in Gath, nor publish it in the streetes of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistims reioyce, lest the daughters of the vncircumcised triumph.","21":"Ye mountaines of Gilboa, vpon you be neither dewe nor raine, nor be there fieldes of offrings: for there the shielde of the mightie is cast downe, the shielde of Saul, as though he had not bene anointed with oyle.","22":"The bow of Ionathan neuer turned backe, neither did the sword of Saul returne emptie from the blood of the slaine, and from the fatte of the mightie.","23":"Saul and Ionathan were louely and pleasant in their liues, and in their deaths they were not deuided: they were swifter then egles, they were stronger then lions.","24":"Yee daughters of Israel, weepe for Saul, which clothed you in skarlet, with pleasures, & hanged ornaments of gold vpon your apparel.","25":"Howe were the mightie slaine in the mids of the battel! O Ionathan, thou wast slaine in thine hie places.","26":"Wo is me for thee, my brother Ionathan: very kinde hast thou bene vnto me: thy loue to me was wonderfull, passing the loue of women:","27":"Howe are the mightie ouerthrowen, and the weapons of warre destroyed!"}
