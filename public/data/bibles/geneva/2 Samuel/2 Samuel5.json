{"1":"Then came all the tribes of Israel to Dauid vnto Hebron, and said thus, Beholde, we are thy bones and thy flesh.","2":"And in time past when Saul was our King, thou leddest Israel in and out: and the Lord hath sayde to thee, Thou shalt feede my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captaine ouer Israel.","3":"So all the Elders of Israel came to the King to Hebron: and King Dauid made a couenant with them in Hebron before the Lorde: & they anoynted Dauid King ouer Israel.","4":"Dauid was thirtie yeere olde when he began to reigne: and hee reigned fortie yeere.","5":"In Hebron hee reigned ouer Iudah seuen yeere, and sixe moneths: and in Ierusalem hee reigned thirtie and three yeeres ouer all Israel and Iudah.","6":"The King also and his men went to Ierusalem vnto the Iebusites, the inhabitants of the land: who spake vnto Dauid, saying, Except thou take away the blinde and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking that Dauid coulde not come thither.","7":"But Dauid tooke the fort of Zion: this is the citie of Dauid.","8":"Nowe Dauid had sayd the same day, Whosoeuer smiteth the Iebusites, and getteth vp to the gutters and smiteth the lame and blinde, which Dauids soule hateth, I will preferre him: therefore they saide, The blinde and the lame shall not come into that house.","9":"So Dauid dwelt in that forte, and called it the citie of Dauid, and Dauid built rounde about it, from Millo, and inward.","10":"And Dauid prospered and grewe: for the Lord God of hostes was with him.","11":"Hiram also king of Tyrus sent messengers to Dauid, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons for walles: and they built Dauid an house.","12":"Then Dauid knewe that the Lorde had stablished him King ouer Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdome for his people Israels sake.","13":"And Dauid tooke him mo concubines & wiues out of Ierusalem, after hee was come from Hebron, & mo sonnes and daughters were borne to Dauid.","14":"And these bee the names of the sonnes that were borne vnto him in Ierusale: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Salomon,","15":"And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Iaphia,","16":"And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.","17":"But when the Philistims hearde that they had anoynted Dauid King ouer Israel, all the Philistims came vp to seeke Dauid: and when Dauid heard, he went downe to a fort.","18":"But the Philistims came, and spred themselues in the valley of Rephaim.","19":"Then Dauid asked counsel of the Lorde, saying, Shall I goe vp to the Philistims? wilt thou deliuer them into mine handes? And the Lorde answered Dauid, Goe vp: for I will doubtlesse deliuer the Philistims into thine handes.","20":"Then Dauid came to Baal-perazim, & smote them there, and sayde, The Lorde hath deuided mine enemies asunder before mee, as waters be deuided asunder: therefore he called the name of that place, Baal-perazim.","21":"And there they left their images, and Dauid and his men burnt them.","22":"Againe the Philistims came vp, and spred themselues in the valley of Rephaim.","23":"And when Dauid asked counsell of the Lorde, hee answered, Thou shalt not goe vp, but turne about behinde them, and come vpon them ouer against the mulberie trees.","24":"And when thou hearest the noyse of one going in the toppes of the mulberie trees, then remoue: for then shall the Lord goe out before thee, to smite the hoste of the Philistims.","25":"Then Dauid did so as the Lorde had commanded him, and smote the Philistims from Geba, vntil thou come to Gazer."}
