{"1":"The word of the Lorde, that came vnto Micah the Morashite in the dayes of Iotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah Kings of Iudah, which he sawe concerning Samaria, and Ierusalem.","2":"Heare, al ye people: hearke thou, O earth, & all that therein is, & let the Lord God be witnes against you, euen ye Lord from his holy Teple.","3":"For beholde, the Lorde commeth out of his place, and will come downe, and tread vpon the hie places of the earth.","4":"And the mountaines shall melt vnder him (so shall the valleys cleaue) as waxe before the fire, and as the waters that are powred downewarde.","5":"For the wickednes of Iaakob is all this, & for the sinnes of the house of Israel: what is the wickednes of Iaakob? Is not Samaria? & which are the hie places of Iudah? Is not Ierusalem?","6":"Therefore I wil make Samaria as an heape of the fielde, and for the planting of a vineyard, and I will cause the stones thereof to tumble downe into the valley, and I will discouer the foundations thereof.","7":"And all the grauen images thereof shalbe broken, and all the giftes thereof shalbe burnt with the fire, and all the idoles thereof will I destroy: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shal returne to the wages of an harlot.","8":"Therefore I will mourne and howle: I wil goe without clothes, and naked: I will make lamentation like the dragons, and mourning as the ostriches.","9":"For her plagues are grieuous: for it is come into Iudah: the enemie is come vnto the gate of my people, vnto Ierusalem.","10":"Declare ye it not at Gath, neither weepe ye: for the house of Aphrah roule thy selfe in the dust.","11":"Thou that dwellest at Shaphir, go together naked with shame: she that dwelleth at Zaanan, shal not come forth in ye mourning of Beth-ezel: the enemie shall receiue of you for his standing.","12":"For the inhabitant of Maroth wayted for good, but euill came from the Lorde vnto the gate of Ierusalem.","13":"O thou inhabitant of Lachish, binde the charet to the beastes of price: she is the beginning of the sinne to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.","14":"Therefore shalt thou giue presents to Moresheth Gath: the houses of Achzib shalbe as a lye to the Kings of Israel.","15":"Yet will I bring an heire vnto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, he shall come vnto Adullam, the glorie of Israel.","16":"Make thee balde: and shaue thee for thy delicate children: enlarge thy baldenesse as the eagle, for they are gone into captiuity from thee."}
