{"1":"Then came to Iesus the Scribes and Pharises, which were of Hierusalem, saying,","2":"Why do thy disciples transgresse the tradition of the Elders? For they wash not their hands when they eate bread.","3":"But he answered & said vnto them, Why doe yee also transgresse the commaundement of God by your tradition?","4":"For God hath commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and he that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.","5":"But ye say, Whosoeuer shal say to father or mother, By the gift that is offered by me, thou maiest haue profite,","6":"Though hee honour not his father, or his mother, shalbe free: thus haue ye made the commaundement of God of no aucthoritie by your tradition.","7":"O hypocrites, Esaias prophecied well of you, saying,","8":"This people draweth neere vnto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with the lips, but their heart is farre off from me.","9":"But in vaine they worship me, teaching for doctrines, mens precepts.","10":"Then hee called the multitude vnto him, and said to them, Heare and vnderstand.","11":"That which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man, but that which commeth out of the mouth, that defileth the man.","12":"Then came his disciples, and saide vnto him, Perceiuest thou not, that the Pharises are offended in hearing this saying?","13":"But hee answered and saide, Euery plant which mine heauenly Father hath not planted, shalbe rooted vp.","14":"Let them alone, they be the blinde leaders of the blinde: and if the blinde leade ye blinde, both shall fall into the ditche.","15":"Then answered Peter, and said to him, Declare vnto vs this parable.","16":"Then said Iesus, Are ye yet without vnderstanding?","17":"Perceiue ye not yet, that whatsoeuer entreth into the mouth, goeth into the bellie, and is cast out into the draught?","18":"But those thinges which proceede out of the mouth, come from the heart, and they defile the man.","19":"For out of the heart come euil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, slaunders.","20":"These are the things, which defile the man: but to eat with vnwashen hands, defileth not ye man.","21":"And Iesus went thence, and departed into the coastes of Tyrus and Sidon.","22":"And beholde, a woman a Cananite came out of the same coasts, and cried, saying vnto him, Haue mercie on me, O Lord, the sonne of Dauid: my daughter is miserably vexed with a deuil.","23":"But hee answered her not a worde. Then came to him his disciples, and besought him, saying, Sende her away, for she crieth after vs.","24":"But he answered, and said, I am not sent, but vnto the lost sheepe of the house of Israel.","25":"Yet she came, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, helpe me.","26":"And he answered, and said, It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to whelps.","27":"But she said, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede the whelpes eate of the crommes, which fall from their masters table.","28":"Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it to thee, as thou desirest; her daughter was made whole at that houre.","29":"So Iesus went away from thence, and came neere vnto the sea of Galile, and went vp into a mountaine and sate downe there.","30":"And great multitudes came vnto him, hauing with them, halt, blinde, dumme, maymed, and many other, and cast them downe at Iesus feete, and he healed them.","31":"In so much that the multitude wondered, to see the dumme speake, the maimed whole, the halt to goe, and the blinde to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.","32":"Then Iesus called his disciples vnto him, and said, I haue compassion on this multitude, because they haue continued with mee already three dayes, & haue nothing to eate: and I wil not let them depart fasting, least they faint in the way.","33":"And his disciples saide vnto him, Whence should we get so much bread in the wildernes, as should suffice so great a multitude!","34":"And Iesus said vnto them, How many loaues haue ye? And they said, Seuen, & a few litle fishes.","35":"Then he commanded the multitude to sit downe on the ground,","36":"And tooke the seuen loaues, and the fishes, and gaue thankes, and brake them, and gaue to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.","37":"And they did all eate, and were sufficed: and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained, seuen baskets full.","38":"And they that had eaten, were foure thousand men, beside women, and litle children.","39":"Then Iesus sent away the multitude, and tooke ship, and came into the partes of Magdala."}
