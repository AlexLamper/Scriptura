She said to him, Graunt that these my two sonnes may sit, the one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand in thy kingdome.","22":"And Iesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye aske. Are ye able to drinke of the cup that I shall drinke of, and to be baptized with the baptisme that I shalbe baptized with? They said to him, We are able.","23":"And he said vnto them, Ye shall drinke in deede of my cup, and shall be baptized with the baptisme, that I am baptized with, but to sit at my right hande, and at my left hand, is not mine to giue: but it shalbe giuen to them for whome it is prepared of my Father.","24":"And when the other ten heard this, they disdained at the two brethren.","25":"Therefore Iesus called them vnto him, and saide, We knowe that the lordes of the Gentiles haue domination ouer them, and they that are great, exercise authoritie ouer them.","26":"But it shall not be so among you: but whosoeuer will be great among you, let him be your seruant.","27":"And whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, let him be your seruant.","28":"Euen as the Sonne of man came not to be serued, but to serue, and to giue his life for the ransome of many.","29":"And as they departed from Iericho, a great multitude followed him.","30":"And beholde, two blinde men, sitting by the way side, when they heard that Iesus passed by, cryed, saying, O Lorde, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs.","31":"And the multitude rebuked them, because they should holde their peace: but they cried the more, saying, O Lord, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs.","32":"Then Iesus stoode still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do to you?","33":"They saide to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.","34":"And Iesus mooued with compassion, touched their eyes, & immediatly their eyes receiued sight, and they followed him."}
