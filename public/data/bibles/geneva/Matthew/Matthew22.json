{"1":"Then Iesus answered, and spake vnto them againe in parables, saying,","2":"The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine King which maried his sonne,","3":"And sent foorth his seruants, to call them that were bidde to the wedding, but they woulde not come.","4":"Againe hee sent foorth other seruants, saying. Tell them which are bidden, Beholde, I haue prepared my dinner: mine oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all thinges are readie: come vnto the mariage.","5":"But they made light of it, and went their wayes, one to his farme, and another about his marchandise.","6":"And the remnant tooke his seruants, and intreated them sharpely, and slewe them.","7":"But when the King heard it, he was wroth, and sent foorth his warriers, and destroyed those murtherers, and burnt vp their citie.","8":"Then saide hee to his seruants, Truly the wedding is prepared: but they which were bidden, were not worthy.","9":"Go ye therefore out into the high wayes, and as many as ye finde, bid them to the mariage.","10":"So those seruantes went out into the hie wayes, and gathered together all that euer they found, both good and bad: so the wedding was furnished with ghestes.","11":"Then the King came in, to see the ghestes, and sawe there a man which had not on a wedding garment.","12":"And he sayd vnto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, and hast not on a wedding garment? And he was speachlesse.","13":"Then sayd the King to the seruants, Binde him hand and foote: take him away, and cast him into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth.","14":"For many are called, but fewe chosen.","15":"Then went the Pharises and tooke counsell how they might tangle him in talke.","16":"And they sent vnto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we knowe that thou art true, & teachest the way of God truly, neither carest for any man: for thou considerest not the person of men.","17":"Tell vs therefore, how thinkest thou? Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto Cesar, or not?","18":"But Iesus perceiued their wickednes, and sayd, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?","19":"Shewe me the tribute money; they brought him a peny.","20":"And he sayde vnto them, Whose is this image and superscription?","21":"They sayd vnto him, Cesars. Then sayd he vnto them, Giue therefore to Cesar, the things which are Cesars, and giue vnto God, those things which are Gods.","22":"And when they heard it, they marueiled, and left him, and went their way.","23":"The same day the Sadduces came to him (which say that there is no resurrection) and asked him,","24":"Saying, Master, Moses sayd, If a man die, hauing no children, his brother shall marie his wife by the right of alliance, and raise vp seede vnto his brother.","25":"Nowe there were with vs seuen brethren, and the first maried a wife, and deceased: and hauing none yssue, left his wife vnto his brother.","26":"Likewise also the second, and the third, vnto the seuenth.","27":"And last of all the woman died also.","28":"Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seuen? For all had her.","29":"Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, Ye are deceiued, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.","30":"For in the resurrection they neither marie wiues, nor wiues are bestowed in mariage, but are as the Angels of God in heauen.","31":"And concerning the resurrection of the dead, haue ye not read what is spoken vuto you of God, saying,","32":"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing.","33":"And when the multitude heard it, they were astonied at his doctrine.","34":"But when the Pharises had heard, that he had put the Sadduces to silence, they assembled together.","35":"And one of them, which was an expounder of the Lawe, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,","36":"Master, which is ye great commaundement in the Lawe?","37":"Iesus sayd to him, Thou shalt loue the Lorde thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy minde.","38":"This is the first and the great commaundement.","39":"And the second is like vnto this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.","40":"On these two commandements hangeth the whole Lawe, and the Prophets.","41":"While the Pharises were gathered together, Iesus asked them,","42":"Saying, What thinke ye of Christ? whose sonne is he? They sayd vnto him, Dauids.","43":"He sayd vnto them, How then doeth Dauid in spirit call him Lord, saying,","44":"The Lord sayd to my Lorde, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footestoole?","45":"If then Dauid call him Lord, howe is he his sonne?","46":"And none could answere him a worde, neither durst any from that day foorth aske him any moe questions."}
