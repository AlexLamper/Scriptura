{"1":"I sawe the Lorde standing vpon the altar, and he sayde, Smite the lintel of the doore, that the postes may shake: and cut them in pieces, euen the heads of them all, and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them, shall not flee away: and he that escapeth of them, shall not be deliuered.","2":"Though they digge into the hel, thence shal mine hande take them: though they clime vp to heauen, thence will I bring them downe.","3":"And though they hide them selues in the toppe of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence: and though they be hid from my sight in the bottome of the sea, thence will I commande the serpent, and he shall bite them.","4":"And though they goe into captiuitie before their enemies, thence wil I commande the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes vpon them for euill, and not for good.","5":"And the Lord God of hosts shall touch the land, and it shall melt away, & al that dwel therein shall mourne, and it shall rise vp wholy like a flood, and shall bee drowned as by the flood of Egypt.","6":"He buildeth his spheres in the heauen, and hath layde the foundation of his globe of elementes in the earth: hee calleth the waters of the sea, and powreth them out vpon the open earth: the Lorde is his Name.","7":"Are ye not as the Ethiopians vnto mee, O children of Israel, sayeth the Lorde? haue not I brought vp Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistims from Caphtor, and Aram fro Kir?","8":"Beholde, the eyes of the Lord God are vpon the sinfull kingdome, and I will destroy it cleane out of the earth. Neuerthelesse I will not vtterly destroy the house of Iaakob, saith the Lord.","9":"For loe, I will command and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corne is sifted in a sieue: yet shall not the least stone fall vpon the earth.","10":"But all the sinners of my people shall dye by the sword, which say, The euill shal not come, nor hasten for vs.","11":"In that day will I raise vp the tabernacle of Dauid, that is fallen downe, and close vp the breaches therof, and I will rayse vp his ruines, and I will builde it, as in the dayes of olde,","12":"That they may possesse the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, because my Name is called vpon them, sayeth the Lorde, that doeth this.","13":"Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall touche the mower, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seede: and the mountaines shall drop sweete wine, and all the hilles shall melt.","14":"And I will bring againe the captiuitie of my people of Israel: and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabite the, and they shall plant vineyardes, and drinke the wine thereof: they shal also make gardens, and eate the fruites of them.","15":"And I wil plant them vpon their land, and they shall no more bee pulled vp againe out of their lande, which I haue giuen them, sayeth the Lord thy God."}
