{"1":"Fvrthermore the Lord spake vnto Moses, after the death of the two sonnes of Aaron, whe they came to offer before the Lord, and dyed:","2":"And the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Speake vnto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the Holy place within the vayle, before the Merciseate, which is vpon the Arke, that he dye not: for I wil appeare in the cloude vpon the Merciseate.","3":"After this sort shall Aaron come into the Holy place: euen with a yong bullocke for a sinne offring, and a ramme for a burnt offring.","4":"He shal put on the holy linnen coate, and shal haue linnen breeches vpon his flesh, & shal be girded with a linnen girdle, and shal couer his head with a linnen miter: these are the holy garments: therefore shal hee wash his flesh in water, when he doeth put them on.","5":"And hee shal take of the Congregation of the children of Israel, two hee goates for a sinne offring, and a ramme for a burnt offring.","6":"Then Aaron shal offer the bullocke for his sinne offring, and make an atonement for himselfe, and for his house.","7":"And he shal take the two hee goates, and present them before the Lord at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.","8":"Then Aaron shal cast lots ouer the two hee goates: one lot for the Lord, and the other for the Scape goate.","9":"And Aaron shal offer the goat, vpon which the Lords lot shal fal, & make him a sinne offring.","10":"But the goate, on which the lot shal fall to be the Scape goate, shalbe presented aliue before the Lord, to make reconciliation by him, & to let him go (as a Scape goate) into the wildernes.","11":"Thus Aaron shal offer the bullocke for his sinne offring, and make a reconciliation for himselfe, and for his house, and shal kill the bullocke for his sinne offring.","12":"And he shal take a censer full of burning coles from off the altar before the Lorde, and his handfull of sweete incense beaten small, & bring it within the vayle,","13":"And shal put the incense vpon the fire before the Lorde, that the cloude of the incense may couer the Merciseat that is vpon the Testimonie: so he shal not dye.","14":"And hee shall take of the blood of the bullocke, and sprinkle it with his finger vpon the Merciseat Eastward: and before the Merciseate shal he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seuen times.","15":"Then shall he kill the goate that is the peoples sinne offring, and bring his blood within the vaile, and doe with that blood, as he did with the blood of the bullocke, and sprinckle it vpon the Merciseate, and before the Merciseate.","16":"So he shal purge the Holy place from the vncleannes of the children of Israel, & from their trespasses of all their sinnes: so shal he do also for the Tabernacle of the Cogregation placed with them, in the middes of their vncleannesse.","17":"And there shalbe no man in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, when he goeth in to make an atonement in the Holy place, vntill hee come out, and haue made an atonement for himselfe, and for his housholde, and for all the Congregation of Israel.","18":"After, he shal goe out vnto the altar that is before the Lord & make a reconciliation vpon it, and shal take of the blood of the bullocke, and of the blood of the goate, and put it vpon the hornes of the Altar round about:","19":"So shal hee sprinkle of the blood vpon it with his finger seuen times, & clense it, & halowe it from the vncleannes of the children of Israel.","20":"When he hath made an ende of purging the Holy place, and the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the altar, then he shall bring the liue goate:","21":"And Aaron shal put both his handes vpon the head of the liue goate, & confesse ouer him al the iniquities of the children of Israel, & all their trespasses, in all their sinnes, putting them vpon the head of the goate, & shal sende him away (by the hand of a man appointed) into the wildernes.","22":"So the goate shal beare vpon him all their iniquities into the land that is not inhabited, & he shal let the goate go into the wildernesse.","23":"After, Aaron shal come into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and put off the linnen clothes, which he put on when he went into the Holy place, and leaue them there.","24":"Hee shal wash also his flesh with water in the Holy place, and put on his owne rayment, and come out, and make his burnt offring, & the burnt offring of the people, and make an atonement for himselfe, and for the people.","25":"Also the fatte of the sinne offring shal he burne vpon the altar.","26":"And he that caried forth the goat, called the Scape goat, shal wash his clothes, & wash his flesh in water, and after that shal come into the hoste.","27":"Also the bullocke for the sinne offring, & the goate for the sinne offring (whose blood was brought to make a reconciliation in the Holy place) shal one carie out without the hoste to be burnt in the fire, with their skinnes, and with their flesh, and with their doung.","28":"And hee that burneth them shal wash his clothes, and wash his flesh in water, and afterward come into the hoste.","29":"So this shalbe an ordinance for euer vnto you: the tenth day of the seuenth moneth, yee shal humble your soules, & do no worke at all, whether it be one of the same countrey or a strager that soiourneth among you.","30":"For that day shal ye Priest make an atonement for you to clense you: ye shalbe cleane from all your sinnes before the Lord.","31":"This shall be a Sabbath of rest vnto you, and ye shal humble your soules, by an ordinance for euer.","32":"And the Priest whom he shal anoynt, & whom he shal cosecrate (to minister in his fathers steade) shal make the atonement, & shal put on the linnen clothes and Holy vestments,","33":"And shal purge the Holy Sanctuarie & the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shal clense the altar, and make an atonement for the Priests and for all the people of the Congregation.","34":"And this shalbe an euerlasting ordinance vnto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sinnes once a yeere: and as the Lord commanded Moses, he did."}
