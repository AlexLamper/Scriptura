I know who thou art, euen the holy one of God.","35":"And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him. Then the deuill throwing him in the middes of them, came out of him, and hurt him nothing at all.","36":"So feare came on them all, and they spake among themselues, saying, What thing is this: for with authoritie and power he commaundeth the foule spirits, and they come out?","37":"And ye fame of him spred abroad throughout all the places of the countrey round about.","38":"And he rose vp, and came out of the Synagogue, and entred into Simons house; Simons wiues mother was taken with a great feuer, and they required him for her.","39":"Then he stoode ouer her, and rebuked the feuer, and it left her, and immediatly she arose, and ministred vnto them.","40":"Now at the sunne setting, all they that had sicke folkes of diuers diseases, brought them vnto him, and he layd his hands on euery one of them, and healed them.","41":"And deuils also came out of many, crying, and saying, Thou art that Christ that Sonne of God: but he rebuked them, and suffered them not to say that they knewe him to be that Christ.","42":"And when it was day, he departed, and went foorth into a desart place, and the people sought him, and came to him, and kept him that he should not depart from them.","43":"But he sayd vnto them, Surely I must also preach the kingdome of God to other cities: for therefore am I sent.","44":"And hee preached in the Synagogues of Galile."}
