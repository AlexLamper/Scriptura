{"1":"And he sayde also vnto his disciples, There was a certaine riche man, which had a stewarde, and he was accused vnto him, that he wasted his goods.","2":"And hee called him, and saide vnto him, Howe is it that I heare this of thee? Giue an accounts of thy stewardship: for thou maiest be no longer steward.","3":"Then the stewarde saide within himselfe, What shall I doe? for my master taketh away from me the stewardship. I cannot digge, and to begge I am ashamed.","4":"I knowe what I will doe, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receiue mee into their houses.","5":"Then called he vnto him euery one of his masters detters, & said vnto the first, Howe much owest thou vnto my master?","6":"And he said, An hudreth measures of oyle; he saide to him, Take thy writing, and sitte downe quickely, and write fiftie.","7":"Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And hee sayde, An hundreth measures of wheate. Then he saide to him, Take thy writing, and write foure score.","8":"And the Lorde commended the vniust stewarde, because he had done wisely. Wherefore the children of this worlde are in their generation wiser then the children of light.","9":"And I say vnto you, Make you friends with the riches of iniquitie, that when ye shal want, they may receiue you into euerlasting habitations.","10":"He that is faithfull in the least, hee is also faithful in much: and he that is vniust in the least, is vniust also in much.","11":"If then ye haue not ben faithful in the wicked riches, who wil trust you in the true treasure?","12":"And if ye haue not bene faithfull in another mans goods, who shall giue you that which is yours?","13":"No seruaunt can serue two masters: for either he shal hate the one, and loue the other: or els he shal leane to the one, and despise the other. Yee can not serue God and riches.","14":"All these thinges heard the Pharises also which were couetous, and they scoffed at him.","15":"Then he sayde vnto them, Yee are they, which iustifie your selues before men: but God knoweth your heartes: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God.","16":"The Lawe and the Prophets endured vntill Iohn: and since that time the kingdome of God is preached, and euery man preasseth into it.","17":"Nowe it is more easie that heauen and earth shoulde passe away, then that one title of the Lawe should fall.","18":"Whosoeuer putteth away his wife, and marieth another, committeth adulterie: and whosoeuer marieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adulterie.","19":"There was a certaine riche man, which was clothed in purple and fine linnen, and fared well and delicately euery day.","20":"Also there was a certaine begger named Lazarus, which was laide at his gate full of sores,","21":"And desired to bee refreshed with the crommes that fell from the riche mans table: yea, and the dogges came and licked his sores.","22":"And it was so that the begger died, and was caried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome. The rich man also died, and was buried.","23":"And being in hell in torments, he lift vp his eyes, and sawe Abraham a farre off, and Lazarus in his bosome.","24":"Then he cried, and saide, Father Abraham, haue mercie on mee, and sende Lazarus that hee may dippe the tip of his finger in water, & coole my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.","25":"But Abraham saide, Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy pleasures, and likewise Lazarus paines: now therefore is he comforted, and thou art tormented.","26":"Besides all this, betweene you & vs there is a great gulfe set, so that they which would goe from hence to you, can not: neither ca they come from thence to vs.","27":"Then he said, I pray thee therfore, father, that thou wouldest sende him to my fathers house,","28":"(For I haue fiue brethren) that he may testifie vnto them, least they also come into this place of torment.","29":"Abraham said vnto him, They haue Moses and the Prophets: let them heare them.","30":"And he sayde, Nay, father Abraham: but if one came vnto them from the dead, they will amend their liues.","31":"Then he saide vnto him, If they heare not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rise from the dead againe."}
