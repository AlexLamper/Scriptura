{"1":"Praise the Lorde, because he is good: for his mercie endureth for euer.","2":"Let them, which haue bene redeemed of the Lord, shewe how he hath deliuered them from the hand of the oppressour,","3":"And gathered them out of the lands, from the East and from the West, from the North and from the South.","4":"When they wandered in the desert and wildernesse out of the waie, and founde no citie to dwell in,","5":"Both hungrie and thirstie, their soule fainted in them.","6":"Then they cried vnto the Lorde in their trouble, & he deliuered them from their distresse,","7":"And led them forth by the right way, that they might goe to a citie of habitation.","8":"Let them therefore confesse before ye Lorde his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull woorkes before the sonnes of men.","9":"For he satisfied the thirstie soule, and filled the hungrie soule with goodnesse.","10":"They that dwell in darkenesse and in the shadowe of death, being bounde in miserie and yron,","11":"Because they rebelled against the wordes of the Lorde, and despised the counsell of the most High,","12":"When he humbled their heart with heauines, then they fell downe and there was no helper.","13":"Then they cried vnto the Lorde in their trouble, & he deliuered them from their distresse.","14":"He brought them out of darkenes, and out of the shadowe of death, and brake their bandes asunder.","15":"Let them therefore cofesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull woorkes before the sonnes of men.","16":"For hee hath broken the gates of brasse, and brast the barres of yron asunder.","17":"Fooles by reason of their transgression, and because of their iniquities are afflicted.","18":"Their soule abhorreth al meat, and they are brought to deaths doore.","19":"Then they crie vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he deliuereth them from their distresse.","20":"He sendeth his worde and healeth them, and deliuereth them from their graues.","21":"Let them therefore cofesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, & his wonderful workes before the sonnes of men,","22":"And let them offer sacrifices of praise, and declare his workes with reioycing.","23":"They that goe downe to the sea in ships, and occupie by the great waters,","24":"They see the woorkes of the Lorde, and his wonders in the deepe.","25":"For he commaundeth and raiseth the stormie winde, and it lifteth vp the waues thereof.","26":"They mount vp to the heauen, and descend to ye deepe, so that their soule melteth for trouble.","27":"They are tossed to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and all their cunning is gone.","28":"Then they crie vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresse.","29":"He turneth the storme to calme, so that the waues thereof are still.","30":"When they are quieted, they are glad, and hee bringeth them vnto the hauen, where they would be.","31":"Let them therfore confesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull woorkes before the sonnes of men.","32":"And let them exalt him in the Congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the Elders.","33":"He turneth the floodes into a wildernesse, and the springs of waters into drinesse,","34":"And a fruitfull land into barrennes for the wickednes of them that dwell therein.","35":"Againe hee turneth the wildernesse into pooles of water, and the drie lande into water springs.","36":"And there he placeth the hungrie, and they builde a citie to dwell in,","37":"And sowe the fieldes, and plant vineyardes, which bring foorth fruitfull increase.","38":"For he blesseth them, & they multiplie exceedingly, and he diminisheth not their cattell.","39":"Againe men are diminished, and brought lowe by oppression, euill and sorowe.","40":"He powreth cotempt vpon princes, & causeth them to erre in desert places out of the way.","41":"Yet he raiseth vp the poore out of miserie, and maketh him families like a flocke of sheepe.","42":"The righteous shall see it, and reioyce, and all iniquitie shall stoppe her mouth.","43":"Who is wise that hee may obserue these things? for they shall vnderstand the louing kindnesse of the Lord."}
