{"1":"To him that excelleth on Gittith. A Psalme of Dauid. O lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the worlde! which hast set thy glory aboue the heauens.","2":"Out of the mouth of babes & suckelings hast thou ordeined strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemie and the auenger.","3":"When I beholde thine heauens, euen the workes of thy fingers, the moone and the starres which thou hast ordeined,","4":"What is man, say I, that thou art mindefull of him? and the sonne of man, that thou visitest him?","5":"For thou hast made him a little lower then God, and crowned him with glory and worship.","6":"Thou hast made him to haue dominion in the workes of thine hands: thou hast put all things vnder his feete:","7":"All sheepe and oxen: yea, and the beastes of the fielde:","8":"The foules of the ayre, and the fish of the sea, and that which passeth through the paths of the seas.","9":"O Lorde our Lorde, howe excellent is thy Name in all the world!"}
