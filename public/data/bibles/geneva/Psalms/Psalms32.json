{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid to giue instruction. Blessed is he whose wickednes is forgiuen, and whose sinne is couered.","2":"Blessed is the man, vnto whom the Lorde imputeth not iniquitie, and in whose spirite there is no guile.","3":"When I helde my tongue, my bones consumed, or when I roared all the day,","4":"(For thine hand is heauie vpon me, day and night: and my moysture is turned into ye drought of summer. Selah)","5":"Then I acknowledged my sinne vnto thee, neither hid I mine iniquitie: for I thought, I will confesse against my selfe my wickednesse vnto the Lord, and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne. Selah.","6":"Therefore shall euery one, that is godly, make his prayer vnto thee in a time, when thou mayest be founde: surely in the flood of great waters they shall not come neere him.","7":"Thou art my secret place: thou preseruest me from trouble: thou compassest me about with ioyfull deliuerance. Selah.","8":"I will instruct thee, and teache thee in the way that thou shalt goe, and I will guide thee with mine eye.","9":"Be ye not like an horse, or like a mule, which vnderstand not: whose mouthes thou doest binde with bit and bridle, least they come neere thee.","10":"Many sorowes shall come to the wicked: but he, that trusteth in the Lorde, mercie shall compasse him.","11":"Be glad ye righteous, and reioyce in the Lorde, and be ioyfull all ye, that are vpright in heart."}
