{"1":"A Psalme of Salomon. Giue thy iudgements to the King, O God, and thy righteousnesse to the Kings sonne.","2":"Then shal he iudge thy people in righteousnesse, and thy poore with equitie.","3":"The mountaines & the hilles shall bring peace to the people by iustice.","4":"He shall iudge the poore of the people: he shall saue the children of the needie, and shal subdue the oppressor.","5":"They shall feare thee as long as the sunne and moone endureth, fro generatio to generation.","6":"He shall come downe like the rayne vpon the mowen grasse, and as the showres that water the earth.","7":"In his dayes shall the righteous florish, and abundance of peace shalbe so long as the moone endureth.","8":"His dominion shall be also from sea to sea, and from the Riuer vnto the endes of the land.","9":"They that dwell in ye wildernes, shall kneele before him, and his enemies shall licke the dust.","10":"The Kings of Tarshish & of the yles shall bring presents: the Kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring giftes.","11":"Yea, all Kings shal worship him: all nations shall serue him.","12":"For he shall deliuer the poore when he cryeth: the needie also, and him that hath no helper.","13":"He shalbe mercifull to the poore and needie, and shall preserue the soules of the poore.","14":"He shall redeeme their soules from deceite and violence, and deare shall their blood be in his sight.","15":"Yea, he shall liue, and vnto him shall they giue of the golde of Sheba: they shall also pray for him continually, and dayly blesse him.","16":"An handfull of corne shall be sowen in the earth, euen in the toppe of the mountaines, and the fruite thereof shall shake like the trees of Lebanon: and the children shall florish out of the citie like the grasse of the earth.","17":"His name shall be for euer: his name shall indure as long as the sunne: all nations shall blesse him, and be blessed in him.","18":"Blessed be the Lorde God, euen the God of Israel, which onely doeth wonderous things.","19":"And blessed be his glorious Name for euer: and let all the earth be filled with his glorie. So be it, euen so be it.","20":"Here end the prayers of Dauid, the sonne of Ishai."}
