{"1":"Prayse ye the Lord. Prayse ye the Lord because he is good, for his mercie endureth for euer.","2":"Who can expresse the noble actes of the Lord, or shewe forth all his prayse?","3":"Blessed are they that keepe iudgement, and doe righteousnesse at all times.","4":"Remember me, O Lorde, with the fauour of thy people: visite me with thy saluation,","5":"That I may see the felicitie of thy chosen, and reioyce in the ioy of thy people, and glorie with thine inheritance.","6":"We haue sinned with our fathers: we haue committed iniquitie, and done wickedly.","7":"Our fathers vnderstoode not thy wonders in Egypt, neither remembred they the multitude of thy mercies, but rebelled at the Sea, euen at the red sea.","8":"Neuerthelesse he saued them for his Names sake, that he might make his power to be knowen.","9":"And he rebuked the red Sea, and it was dryed vp, and he led them in the deepe, as in the wildernesse.","10":"And he saued them from ye aduersaries hand, and deliuered them from ye hand of the enemie.","11":"And the waters couered their oppressours: not one of them was left.","12":"Then beleeued they his wordes, and sang prayse vnto him.","13":"But incontinently they forgate his workes: they wayted not for his counsell,","14":"But lusted with concupiscence in the wildernes, and tempted God in the desert.","15":"Then he gaue them their desire: but he sent leannesse into their soule.","16":"They enuied Moses also in the tentes, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord.","17":"Therefore the earth opened & swallowed vp Dathan, & couered the companie of Abiram.","18":"And the fire was kindled in their assembly: the flame burnt vp the wicked.","19":"They made a calfe in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.","20":"Thus they turned their glory into the similitude of a bullocke, that eateth grasse.","21":"They forgate God their Sauiour, which had done great things in Egypt,","22":"Wonderous woorkes in the lande of Ham, and fearefull things by the red Sea.","23":"Therefore he minded to destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stand in the breach before him to turne away his wrath, least he shoulde destroy them.","24":"Also they contemned that pleasant land, and beleeued not his worde,","25":"But murmured in their tentes, and hearkened not vnto the voice of the Lorde.","26":"Therefore hee lifted vp his hande against them, to destroy them in the wildernesse,","27":"And to destroy their seede among the nations, & to scatter them throughout the countries.","28":"They ioyned themselues also vnto Baalpeor, and did eate the offrings of the dead.","29":"Thus they prouoked him vnto anger with their owne inuentions, and the plague brake in vpon them.","30":"But Phinehas stoode vp, and executed iudgement, and the plague was staied.","31":"And it was imputed vnto him for righteousnes from generation to generation for euer.","32":"They angred him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was punished for their sakes,","33":"Because they vexed his spirite, so that hee spake vnaduisedly with his lippes.","34":"Neither destroied they the people, as the Lord had commaunded them,","35":"But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their workes,","36":"And serued their idoles, which were their ruine.","37":"Yea, they offered their sonnes, and their daughters vnto deuils,","38":"And shed innocent blood, euen the blood of their sonnes, & of their daughters, whome they offred vnto the idoles of Canaan, and the lande was defiled with blood.","39":"Thus were they steined with their owne woorkes, and went a whoring with their owne inuentions.","40":"Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and he abhorred his owne inheritance.","41":"And hee gaue them into the hande of the heathen: and they that hated them, were lordes ouer them.","42":"Their enemies also oppressed them, & they were humbled vnder their hand.","43":"Many a time did hee deliuer them, but they prouoked him by their counsels: therefore they were brought downe by their iniquitie.","44":"Yet hee sawe when they were in affliction, and he heard their crie.","45":"And he remembred his couenant towarde them and repented acoording to the multitude of his mercies,","46":"And gaue them fauour in the sight of all them that lead them captiues.","47":"Saue vs, O Lorde our God, and gather vs from among the heathen, that we may praise thine holy Name, and glorie in thy praise.","48":"Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel for euer and euer, and let all the people say, So be it. Praise yee the Lord."}
