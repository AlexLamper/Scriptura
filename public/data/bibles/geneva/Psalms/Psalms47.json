All people clap your hands: sing loude vnto God with a ioyfull voyce.","2":"For the Lord is high, and terrible: a great King ouer all the earth.","3":"He hath subdued the people vnder vs, and the nations vnder our feete.","4":"Hee hath chosen our inheritance for vs: euen the glory of Iaakob whom he loued. Selah.","5":"God is gone vp with triumph, euen the Lord, with the sound of the trumpet.","6":"Sing prayses to God, sing prayses: sing prayses vnto our King, sing prayses.","7":"For God is the King of all the earth: sing prayses euery one that hath vnderstanding.","8":"God reigneth ouer the heathen: God sitteth vpon his holy throne.","9":"The princes of the people are gathered vnto the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the world belong to God: he is greatly to be exalted."}
