{"1":"My soule, prayse thou the Lord: O Lord my God, thou art exceeding great, thou art clothed with glorie and honour.","2":"Which couereth himselfe with light as with a garment, and spreadeth the heauens like a curtaine.","3":"Which layeth the beames of his chambers in the waters, and maketh the cloudes his chariot, and walketh vpon the wings of the winde.","4":"Which maketh his spirits his messengers, and a flaming fire his ministers.","5":"He set the earth vpon her foundations, so that it shall neuer moue.","6":"Thou coueredst it with the deepe as with a garment: the waters woulde stand aboue the mountaines.","7":"But at thy rebuke they flee: at the voyce of thy thunder they haste away.","8":"And the mountaines ascend, and the valleis descend to the place which thou hast established for them.","9":"But thou hast set them a bounde, which they shall not passe: they shall not returne to couer the earth.","10":"He sendeth the springs into the valleis, which runne betweene the mountaines.","11":"They shall giue drinke to all the beasts of the fielde, and the wilde asses shall quench their thirst.","12":"By these springs shall the foules of the heauen dwell, and sing among the branches.","13":"He watereth the mountaines from his chambers, and the earth is filled with the fruite of thy workes.","14":"He causeth grasse to growe for the cattell, and herbe for the vse of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth,","15":"And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oyle to make the face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth mans heart.","16":"The high trees are satisfied, euen the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted,","17":"That ye birdes may make their nestes there: the storke dwelleth in the firre trees.","18":"The high mountaines are for the goates: the rockes are a refuge for the conies.","19":"He appoynted the moone for certaine seasons: the sunne knoweth his going downe.","20":"Thou makest darkenesse, and it is night, wherein all the beastes of the forest creepe forth.","21":"The lions roare after their praye, and seeke their meate at God.","22":"When the sunne riseth, they retire, and couche in their dennes.","23":"Then goeth man forth to his worke, and to his labour vntill the euening.","24":"O Lord, howe manifolde are thy workes! in wisdome hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.","25":"So is this sea great and wide: for therein are things creeping innumerable, both small beastes and great.","26":"There goe the shippes, yea, that Liuiathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.","27":"All these waite vpon thee, that thou maiest giue them foode in due season.","28":"Thou giuest it to them, and they gather it: thou openest thine hand, and they are filled with good things.","29":"But if thou hide thy face, they are troubled: if thou take away their breath, they dye and returne to their dust.","30":"Againe if thou send forth thy spirit, they are created, and thou renuest the face of the earth.","31":"Glory be to the Lord for euer: let the Lord reioyce in his workes.","32":"He looketh on the earth and it trembleth: he toucheth the mountaines, and they smoke.","33":"I will sing vnto the Lord all my life: I will prayse my God, while I liue.","34":"Let my wordes be acceptable vnto him: I will reioyce in the Lord.","35":"Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the wicked till there be no more: O my soule, prayse thou the Lord. Prayse ye the Lord."}
