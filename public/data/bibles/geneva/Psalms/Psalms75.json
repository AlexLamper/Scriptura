{"1":"To him that excelleth Destroy not. A Psalme or song committed to Asaph. We will prayse thee, O God, we will prayse thee, for thy Name is neere: therefore they will declare thy wonderous workes.","2":"When I shall take a conuenient time, I will iudge righteously.","3":"The earth and all the inhabitantes thereof are dissolued: but I will establish the pillers of it. Selah.","4":"I saide vnto the foolish, Be not so foolish, and to the wicked, Lift not vp the horne.","5":"Lift not vp your horne on high, neither speake with a stiffe necke.","6":"For to come to preferment is neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South,","7":"But God is the iudge: he maketh lowe and he maketh hie.","8":"For in the hand of the Lord is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixt, and he powreth out of the same: surely all the wicked of the earth shall wring out and drinke the dregges thereof.","9":"But I will declare for euer, and sing prayses vnto the God of Iaakob.","10":"All the hornes of the wicked also will I breake: but the hornes of the righteous shalbe exalted."}
