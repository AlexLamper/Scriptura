{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. When he was in the wildernesse of Iudah. O God, thou art my God, earely will I seeke thee: my soule thirsteth for thee: my flesh longeth greatly after thee in a barren and drye land without water.","2":"Thus I beholde thee as in the Sanctuarie, when I beholde thy power and thy glorie.","3":"For thy louing kindnesse is better then life: therefore my lippes shall prayse thee.","4":"Thus will I magnifie thee all my life, and lift vp mine hands in thy name.","5":"My soule shalbe satisfied, as with marowe and fatnesse, and my mouth shall praise thee with ioyfull lippes,","6":"When I remember thee on my bedde, and when I thinke vpon thee in the night watches.","7":"Because thou hast bene mine helper, therefore vnder the shadow of thy wings wil I reioyce.","8":"My soule cleaueth vnto thee: for thy right hand vpholdeth me.","9":"Therefore they that seeke my soule to destroy it, they shall goe into the lowest partes of the earth.","10":"They shall cast him downe with the edge of the sword, and they shall be a portion for foxes.","11":"But the King shall reioyce in God, and all that sweare by him shall reioyce in him: for the mouth of them that speake lyes, shall be stopped."}
