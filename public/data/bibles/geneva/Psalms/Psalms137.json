{"1":"By the riuers of Babel we sate, and there wee wept, when we remembred Zion.","2":"Wee hanged our harpes vpon the willowes in the middes thereof.","3":"Then they that ledde vs captiues, required of vs songs and mirth, when wee had hanged vp our harpes, saying, Sing vs one of the songs of Zion.","4":"Howe shall we sing, said we, a song of the Lord in a strange land?","5":"If I forget thee, O Ierusalem, let my right hand forget to play.","6":"If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth: yea, if I preferre not Ierusalem to my chiefe ioy.","7":"Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Ierusalem, which saide, Rase it, rase it to the foundation thereof.","8":"O daughter of Babel, worthy to be destroyed, blessed shall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast serued vs.","9":"Blessed shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy children against the stones."}
