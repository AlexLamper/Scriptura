{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. Deliuer me, O Lord, from the euill man: preserue me from the cruel man:","2":"Which imagine euill things in their heart, and make warre continually.","3":"They haue sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders poyson is vnder their lips. Selah.","4":"Keepe mee, O Lord, from the handes of the wicked: preserue mee from the cruell man, which purposeth to cause my steppes to slide.","5":"The proude haue layde a snare for me, and spred a nette with cordes in my pathway, and set grennes for me. Selah.","6":"Therefore I saide vnto the Lorde, Thou art my God: heare, O Lord, the voyce of my prayers.","7":"O Lord God the strength of my saluation, thou hast couered mine head in the day of battel.","8":"Let not the wicked haue his desire, O Lord: performe not his wicked thought, least they be proude. Selah.","9":"As for the chiefe of them, that compasse me about, let the mischiefe of their owne lippes come vpon them.","10":"Let coles fal vpon them: let him cast them into the fire, & into the deepe pits, that they rise not.","11":"For the backbiter shall not be established vpon the earth: euill shall hunt the cruell man to destruction.","12":"I know that the Lord will auenge the afflicted, and iudge the poore.","13":"Surely the righteous shal prayse thy Name, and the iust shall dwell in thy presence."}
