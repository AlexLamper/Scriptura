Incline thine eare, O Lord, and heare me: for I am poore and needy.","2":"Preserue thou my soule, for I am mercifull: my God, saue thou thy seruant, that trusteth in thee.","3":"Be mercifull vnto me, O Lord: for I crie vpon thee continually.","4":"Reioyce the soule of thy seruant: for vnto thee, O Lord, doe I lift vp my soule.","5":"For thou, Lord, art good and mercifull, and of great kindenes vnto all them, that call vpon thee.","6":"Giue eare, Lord, vnto my prayer, & hearken to the voyce of my supplication.","7":"In the day of my trouble I will call vpon thee: for thou hearest me.","8":"Among the gods there is none like thee, O Lorde, and there is none that can doe like thy workes.","9":"All nations, whome thou hast made, shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, & shall glorifie thy Name.","10":"For thou art great and doest wonderous things: thou art God alone.","11":"Teach me thy way, O Lorde, and I will walke in thy trueth: knit mine heart vnto thee, that I may feare thy Name.","12":"I wil prayse thee, O Lord my God, with all mine heart: yea, I wil glorifie thy Name for euer.","13":"For great is thy mercie toward me, & thou hast deliuered my soule from the lowest graue.","14":"O God, the proude are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men haue sought my soule, and haue not set thee before them.","15":"But thou, O Lorde, art a pitifull God and mercifull, slowe to anger and great in kindenes and trueth.","16":"Turne vnto me, and haue mercy vpon me: giue thy strength vnto thy seruant, and saue the sonne of thine handmayd.","17":"Shew a token of thy goodnes towarde me, that they which hate me, may see it, and be ashamed, because thou, O Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me."}
