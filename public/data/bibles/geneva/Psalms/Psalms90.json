{"1":"A prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, thou hast bene our habitation from generation to generation.","2":"Before the mountaines were made, and before thou hadst formed the earth, and the world, euen from euerlasting to euerlasting thou art our God.","3":"Thou turnest man to destruction: againe thou sayest, Returne, ye sonnes of Adam.","4":"For a thousande yeeres in thy sight are as yesterday when it is past, & as a watch in the night.","5":"Thou hast ouerflowed them: they are as a sleepe: in the morning he groweth like the grasse:","6":"In the morning it florisheth and groweth, but in the euening it is cut downe and withereth.","7":"For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.","8":"Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, and our secret sinnes in the light of thy countenance.","9":"For all our dayes are past in thine anger: we haue spent our yeeres as a thought.","10":"The time of our life is threescore yeeres and ten, and if they be of strength, fourescore yeeres: yet their strength is but labour and sorowe: for it is cut off quickly, and we flee away.","11":"Who knoweth the power of thy wrath? for according to thy feare is thine anger.","12":"Teach vs so to nomber our dayes, that we may apply our heartes vnto wisdome.","13":"Returne (O Lord, howe long?) and be pacified toward thy seruants.","14":"Fill vs with thy mercie in the morning: so shall we reioyce and be glad all our dayes.","15":"Comfort vs according to the dayes that thou hast afflicted vs, and according to the yeeres that we haue seene euill.","16":"Let thy worke bee seene towarde thy seruants, and thy glory vpon their children.","17":"And let the beautie of the Lord our God be vpon vs, & direct thou the worke of our hands vpon vs, euen direct the worke of our handes."}
