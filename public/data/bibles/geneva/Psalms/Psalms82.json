{"1":"A Psalme committed to Asaph. God standeth in the assemblie of gods: hee iudgeth among gods.","2":"How long wil ye iudge vniustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.","3":"Doe right to the poore and fatherlesse: doe iustice to the poore and needie.","4":"Deliuer the poore and needie: saue them from the hand of the wicked.","5":"They knowe not and vnderstand nothing: they walke in darkenes, albeit all the foundations of the earth be mooued.","6":"I haue said, Ye are gods, and ye all are children of the most High.","7":"But ye shall die as a man, and yee princes, shall fall like others.","8":"O God, arise, therefore iudge thou the earth: for thou shalt inherite all nations."}
