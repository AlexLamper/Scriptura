{"1":"A prayer of the afflicted, when hee shall be in distresse, and poure foorth his meditation before the Lorde. O Lorde, heare my prayer, and let my crye come vnto thee.","2":"Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine eares vnto me: when I call, make haste to heare me.","3":"For my dayes are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burnt like an herthe.","4":"Mine heart is smitten and withereth like grasse, because I forgate to eate my bread.","5":"For the voyce of my groning my bones doe cleaue to my skinne.","6":"I am like a pelicane of the wildernesse: I am like an owle of the deserts.","7":"I watch and am as a sparrowe alone vpon the house top.","8":"Mine enemies reuile me dayly, and they that rage against me, haue sworne against me.","9":"Surely I haue eaten asshes as bread, and mingled my drinke with weeping,","10":"Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast heaued me vp, and cast me downe.","11":"My dayes are like a shadowe that fadeth, and I am withered like grasse.","12":"But thou, O Lorde, doest remaine for euer, and thy remembrance from generation to generation.","13":"Thou wilt arise & haue mercy vpon Zion: for the time to haue mercie thereon, for the appointed time is come.","14":"For thy seruants delite in the stones thereof, and haue pitie on the dust thereof.","15":"Then the heathen shall feare the Name of the Lord, and all the Kings of the earth thy glory,","16":"When the Lorde shall build vp Zion, and shall appeare in his glory,","17":"And shall turne vnto the prayer of the desolate, and not despise their prayer.","18":"This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people, which shalbe created, shall prayse the Lord.","19":"For he hath looked downe from the height of his Sanctuarie: out of the heauen did the Lord beholde the earth,","20":"That he might heare the mourning of the prisoner, and deliuer the children of death:","21":"That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Zion, and his prayse in Ierusalem,","22":"When the people shalbe gathered together, and the kingdomes to serue the Lorde.","23":"He abated my strength in the way, and shortened my dayes.","24":"And I sayd, O my God, take me not away in the middes of my dayes: thy yeeres endure from generation to generation.","25":"Thou hast aforetime layde the foundation of the earth, and the heauens are the worke of thine hands.","26":"They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: euen they all shall waxe olde as doeth a garment: as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.","27":"But thou art the same, and thy yeeres shall not fayle.","28":"The children of thy seruants shall continue, and their seede shall stand fast in thy sight."}
