{"1":"To him that excelleth vpon Aiieleth Hasshahar. A Psalme of Dauid. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, and art so farre from mine health, and from the wordes of my roaring?","2":"O my God, I crie by day, but thou hearest not, and by night, but haue no audience.","3":"But thou art holy, and doest inhabite the prayses of Israel.","4":"Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didest deliuer them.","5":"They called vpon thee, and were deliuered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.","6":"But I am a worme, and not a man: a shame of men, and the contempt of the people.","7":"All they that see me, haue me in derision: they make a mowe and nod the head, saying,","8":"He trusted in the Lorde, let him deliuer him: let him saue him, seeing he loueth him.","9":"But thou didest draw me out of ye wombe: thou gauest me hope, euen at my mothers breasts.","10":"I was cast vpon thee, euen from ye wombe: thou art my God from my mothers belly.","11":"Be not farre from me, because trouble is neere: for there is none to helpe me.","12":"Many yong bulles haue compassed me: mightie bulles of Bashan haue closed me about.","13":"They gape vpon me with their mouthes, as a ramping and roaring lyon.","14":"I am like water powred out, and all my bones are out of ioynt: mine heart is like waxe: it is molten in the middes of my bowels.","15":"My strength is dryed vp like a potsheard, and my tongue cleaueth to my iawes, and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.","16":"For dogges haue compassed me, and the assemblie of the wicked haue inclosed me: they perced mine hands and my feete.","17":"I may tell all my bones: yet they beholde, and looke vpon me.","18":"They part my garments among them, and cast lottes vpon my vesture.","19":"But be thou not farre off, O Lorde, my strength: hasten to helpe me.","20":"Deliuer my soule from the sword: my desolate soule from the power of the dogge.","21":"Saue me from the lyons mouth, and answere me in sauing me from the hornes of the vnicornes.","22":"I wil declare thy Name vnto my brethren: in the middes of the Congregation will I praise thee, saying,","23":"Prayse the Lord, ye that feare him: magnifie ye him, all the seede of Iaakob, and feare ye him, all the seede of Israel.","24":"For he hath not despised nor abhorred ye affliction of the poore: neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he called vnto him, he heard.","25":"My prayse shalbe of thee in the great Congregation: my vowes will I perfourme before them that feare him.","26":"The poore shall eate and be satisfied: they that seeke after the Lorde, shall prayse him: your heart shall liue for euer.","27":"All the endes of the worlde shall remember themselues, and turne to the Lord: and all the kinreds of the nations shall worship before thee.","28":"For the kingdome is the Lords, and he ruleth among the nations.","29":"All they that be fat in the earth, shall eate and worship: all they that go downe into the dust, shall bowe before him, euen he that cannot quicken his owne soule.","30":"Their seede shall serue him: it shalbe counted vnto the Lord for a generation.","31":"They shall come, and shall declare his righteousnesse vnto a people that shall be borne, because he hath done it."}
