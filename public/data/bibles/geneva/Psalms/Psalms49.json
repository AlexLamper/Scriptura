{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme committed to the sonnes of Korah. Heare this, all ye people: giue eare, all ye that dwell in the world,","2":"As well lowe as hie, both rich and poore.","3":"My mouth shal speake of wisdome, and the meditation of mine heart is of knowledge.","4":"I will incline mine eare to a parable, and vtter my graue matter vpon the harpe.","5":"Wherefore should I feare in the euil dayes, when iniquitie shal compasse me about, as at mine heeles?","6":"They trust in their goods, and boast them selues in the multitude of their riches.","7":"Yet a man can by no meanes redeeme his brother: he can not giue his raunsome to God,","8":"(So precious is the redemption of their soules, and the continuance for euer)","9":"That he may liue still for euer, and not see the graue.","10":"For he seeth that wise men die, and also that the ignorant and foolish perish, & leaue their riches for others.","11":"Yet they thinke, their houses, and their habitations shall continue for euer, euen from generation to generation, and call their lands by their names.","12":"But man shall not continue in honour: he is like the beastes that die.","13":"This their way vttereth their foolishnes: yet their posteritie delite in their talke. Selah.","14":"Like sheepe they lie in graue: death deuoureth them, and the righteous shall haue domination ouer them in the morning: for their beautie shall consume, when they shall goe from their house to graue.","15":"But God shall deliuer my soule from the power of the graue: for he will receiue me. Selah.","16":"Be not thou afrayd when one is made rich, and when the glory of his house is increased.","17":"For he shall take nothing away when he dieth, neither shal his pompe descende after him.","18":"For while he liued, he reioyced himselfe: and men will prayse thee, when thou makest much of thy selfe.","19":"He shal enter into the generation of his fathers, and they shall not liue for euer.","20":"Man is in honour, and vnderstandeth not: he is like to beasts that perish."}
