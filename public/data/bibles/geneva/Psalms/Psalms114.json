{"1":"When Israel went out of Egypt, and the house of Iaakob from the barbarous people,","2":"Iudah was his sanctification, and Israel his dominion.","3":"The Sea sawe it and fled: Iorden was turned backe.","4":"The mountaines leaped like rams, and the hils as lambes.","5":"What ailed thee, O Sea, that thou fleddest? O Iorden, why wast thou turned backe?","6":"Ye mountaines, why leaped ye like rams, and ye hils as lambes?","7":"The earth trembled at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Iaakob,","8":"Which turneth the rocke into waterpooles, and the flint into a fountaine of water."}
