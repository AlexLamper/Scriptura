{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme to giue instruction, committed to the sonnes of Korah. Wee haue heard with our eares, O God: our fathers haue tolde vs the workes, that thou hast done in their dayes, in the olde time:","2":"Howe thou hast driuen out the heathen with thine hand, & planted them: how thou hast destroyed the people, & caused them to grow.","3":"For they inherited not the lande by their owne sworde, neither did their owne arme saue them: but thy right hand, and thine arme and the light of thy countenance, because thou didest fauour them.","4":"Thou art my King, O God: send helpe vnto Iaakob.","5":"Through thee haue we thrust backe our aduersaries: by thy Name haue we troden downe them that rose vp against vs.","6":"For I do not trust in my bowe, neither can my sworde saue me.","7":"But thou hast saued vs from our aduersaries, and hast put them to confusion that hate vs.","8":"Therefore will wee praise God continually, and will confesse thy Name for euer. Selah.","9":"But now thou art farre off, and puttest vs to confusion, and goest not forth with our armies.","10":"Thou makest vs to turne backe fro the aduersary, & they, which hate vs, spoile for theselues.","11":"Thou giuest vs as sheepe to bee eaten, and doest scatter vs among the nations.","12":"Thou sellest thy people without gaine, and doest not increase their price.","13":"Thou makest vs a reproche to our neighbours, a iest and a laughing stocke to them that are round about vs.","14":"Thou makest vs a prouerbe among the nations, & a nodding of the head among the people.","15":"My confusion is dayly before me, and the shame of my face hath couered me,","16":"For the voyce of the slaunderer and rebuker, for the enemie and auenger.","17":"All this is come vpon vs, yet doe wee not forget thee, neither deale wee falsly concerning thy couenant.","18":"Our heart is not turned backe: neither our steps gone out of thy paths,","19":"Albeit thou hast smitten vs downe into the place of dragons, and couered vs with the shadow of death.","20":"If wee haue forgotten the Name of our God, and holden vp our hands to a strange god,","21":"Shall not God searche this out? for hee knoweth the secrets of the heart.","22":"Surely for thy sake are we slaine continually, & are counted as sheepe for the slaughter.","23":"Vp, why sleepest thou, O Lord? awake, be not farre off for euer.","24":"Wherefore hidest thou thy face? and forgettest our miserie and our affliction?","25":"For our soule is beaten downe vnto the dust: our belly cleaueth vnto the ground.","26":"Rise vp for our succour, and redeeme vs for thy mercies sake."}
