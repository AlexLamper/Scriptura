{"1":"A song of degrees. They that trust in the Lord, shalbe as mount Zion, which can not be remooued, but remaineth for euer.","2":"As the mountaines are about Ierusalem: so is the Lord about his people from henceforth and for euer.","3":"For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous, least the righteous put forth their hand vnto wickednes.","4":"Doe well, O Lord, vnto those that be good and true in their hearts.","5":"But these that turne aside by their crooked wayes, them shal the Lord leade with the workers of iniquitie: but peace shalbe vpon Israel."}
