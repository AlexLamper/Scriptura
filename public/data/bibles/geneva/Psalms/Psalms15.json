{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. Lorde, who shal dwell in thy Tabernacle? who shall rest in thine holy Mountaine?","2":"He that walketh vprightly and worketh righteousnes, and speaketh the trueth in his heart.","3":"He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth euill to his neighbour, nor receiueth a false report against his neighbour.","4":"In whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoureth them that feare the Lord: he that sweareth to his owne hinderance & changeth not.","5":"He that giueth not his money vnto vsurie, nor taketh reward against the innocent: hee that doeth these things, shall neuer be moued."}
