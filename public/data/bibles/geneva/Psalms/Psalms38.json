{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid for remembrance. O Lorde, rebuke mee not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy wrath.","2":"For thine arrowes haue light vpon me, and thine hand lyeth vpon me.","3":"There is nothing sound in my flesh, because of thine anger: neither is there rest in my bones because of my sinne.","4":"For mine iniquities are gone ouer mine head, and as a weightie burden they are too heauie for me.","5":"My woundes are putrified, and corrupt because of my foolishnes.","6":"I am bowed, and crooked very sore: I goe mourning all the day.","7":"For my reines are full of burning, and there is nothing sound in my flesh.","8":"I am weakened and sore broken: I roare for the very griefe of mine heart.","9":"Lorde, I powre my whole desire before thee, and my sighing is not hid from thee.","10":"Mine heart panteth: my strength faileth me, and the light of mine eyes, euen they are not mine owne.","11":"My louers and my friends stand aside from my plague, and my kinsmen stand a farre off.","12":"They also, that seeke after my life, laye snares, and they that go about to do me euil, talke wicked things and imagine deceite continually.","13":"But I as a deafe man heard not, and am as a dumme man, which openeth not his mouth.","14":"Thus am I as a man, that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofes.","15":"For on thee, O Lord, do I waite: thou wilt heare me, my Lord, my God.","16":"For I said, Heare me, least they reioyce ouer me: for when my foote slippeth, they extol themselues against me.","17":"Surely I am ready to halte, and my sorow is euer before me.","18":"When I declare my paine, and am sory for my sinne,","19":"Then mine enemies are aliue & are mightie, and they that hate me wrongfully are many.","20":"They also, that rewarde euill for good, are mine aduersaries, because I followe goodnesse.","21":"Forsake me not, O Lord: be not thou farre from me, my God.","22":"Haste thee to helpe mee, O my Lorde, my saluation."}
