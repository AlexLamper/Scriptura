{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. The Lord said vnto my Lorde, Sit thou at my right hand, vntill I make thine enemies thy footestoole.","2":"The Lorde shall send the rod of thy power out of Zion: be thou ruler in the middes of thine enemies.","3":"Thy people shall come willingly at the time of assembling thine armie in holy beautie: the youth of thy wombe shalbe as the morning dewe.","4":"The Lord sware & wil not repent, Thou art a Priest for euer after ye order of Melchi-zedek.","5":"The Lorde, that is at thy right hand, shall wound Kings in the day of his wrath.","6":"He shalbe iudge among the heathen: he shall fill all with dead bodies, and smite the head ouer great countreis.","7":"He shall drinke of the brooke in the way: therefore shall he lift vp his head."}
