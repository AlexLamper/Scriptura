{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. Howe long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for euer? howe long wilt thou hide thy face from me?","2":"How long shall I take counsell within my selfe, hauing wearinesse dayly in mine heart? how long shall mine enemie be exalted aboue me?","3":"Beholde, and heare mee, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleepe not in death:","4":"Lest mine enemie say, I haue preuailed against him: and they that afflict me, reioyce when I slide.","5":"But I trust in thy mercie: mine heart shall reioyce in thy saluation:","6":"I will sing to the Lord, because he hath delt louingly with me."}
