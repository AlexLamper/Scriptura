{"1":"O Lord God the auenger, O God the auenger, shewe thy selfe clearely.","2":"Exalt thy selfe, O Iudge of the worlde, and render a reward to the proude.","3":"Lord how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?","4":"They prate and speake fiercely: all the workers of iniquitie vaunt themselues.","5":"They smite downe thy people, O Lorde, and trouble thine heritage.","6":"They slay the widowe and the stranger, and murther the fatherlesse.","7":"Yet they say, The Lord shall not see: neither will the God of Iaakob regard it.","8":"Vnderstande ye vnwise among the people: and ye fooles, when will ye be wise?","9":"Hee that planted the eare, shall hee not heare? or he that formed the eye, shall he not see?","10":"Or he that chastiseth the nations, shall he not correct? hee that teacheth man knowledge, shall he not knowe?","11":"The Lord knoweth the thoughtes of man, that they are vanitie.","12":"Blessed is the man, whom thou chastisest, O Lord, and teachest him in thy Lawe,","13":"That thou mayest giue him rest from the dayes of euill, whiles the pitte is digged for the wicked.","14":"Surely the Lorde will not faile his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.","15":"For iudgement shal returne to iustice, and all the vpright in heart shall followe after it.","16":"Who will rise vp with me against the wicked? or who will take my part against the workers of iniquitie?","17":"If the Lord had not holpen me, my soule had almost dwelt in silence.","18":"When I said, My foote slideth, thy mercy, O Lord, stayed me.","19":"In the multitude of my thoughts in mine heart, thy comfortes haue reioyced my soule.","20":"Hath the throne of iniquitie fellowship with thee, which forgeth wrong for a Lawe?","21":"They gather them together against the soule of the righteous, and condemne the innocent blood.","22":"But the Lorde is my refuge, and my God is the rocke of mine hope.","23":"And hee will recompence them their wickednes, and destroy them in their owne malice: yea, the Lord our God shall destroy them."}
