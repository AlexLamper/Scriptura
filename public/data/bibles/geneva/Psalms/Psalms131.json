{"1":"A song of degrees or Psalme of Dauid. Lorde, mine heart is not hautie, neither are mine eyes loftie, neither haue I walked in great matters and hid from me.","2":"Surely I haue behaued my selfe, like one wained from his mother, and kept silence: I am in my selfe as one that is wained.","3":"Let Israel waite on the Lord from hencefoorth and for euer."}
