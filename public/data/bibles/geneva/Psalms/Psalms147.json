{"1":"Prayse ye the Lorde, for it is good to sing vnto our God: for it is a pleasant thing, and praise is comely.","2":"The Lord doth builde vp Ierusalem, and gather together the dispersed of Israel.","3":"He healeth those that are broken in heart, and bindeth vp their sores.","4":"He counteth the nomber of the starres, and calleth them all by their names.","5":"Great is our Lord, and great is his power: his wisdome is infinite.","6":"The Lord relieueth the meeke, and abaseth the wicked to the ground.","7":"Sing vnto the Lord with prayse: sing vpon the harpe vnto our God,","8":"Which couereth the heauen with cloudes, and prepareth raine for the earth, and maketh the grasse to growe vpon the mountaines:","9":"Which giueth to beasts their foode, and to the yong rauens that crie.","10":"He hath not pleasure in the strength of an horse, neither delighteth he in the legs of man.","11":"But the Lorde deliteth in them that feare him, and attende vpon his mercie.","12":"Prayse the Lorde, O Ierusalem: prayse thy God, O Zion.","13":"For he hath made the barres of thy gates strong, and hath blessed thy children within thee.","14":"He setteth peace in thy borders, and satisfieth thee with the floure of wheate.","15":"He sendeth foorth his commaundement vpon earth, and his worde runneth very swiftly.","16":"He giueth snowe like wooll, and scattereth the hoare frost like ashes.","17":"He casteth foorth his yce like morsels: who can abide the colde thereof?","18":"He sendeth his worde and melteth them: he causeth his winde to blowe, and the waters flowe.","19":"He sheweth his word vnto Iaakob, his statutes and his iudgements vnto Israel.","20":"He hath not dealt so with euery nation, neither haue they knowen his iudgements. Prayse ye the Lord."}
