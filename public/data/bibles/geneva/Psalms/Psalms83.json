{"1":"A song, or Psalme committed to Asaph. Keepe not thou silence, O God: bee not still, and cease not, O God.","2":"For lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee, haue lifted vp the head.","3":"They haue taken craftie counsell against thy people, and haue consulted against thy secret ones.","4":"They haue said, Come and let vs cut them off from being a nation: and let the name of Israel be no more in remembrance.","5":"For they haue consulted together in heart, and haue made a league against thee:","6":"The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Agarims:","7":"Gebal and Ammon, and Amalech, the Philistims with the inhabitants of Tyrus:","8":"Asshur also is ioyned with them: they haue bene an arme to the children of Lot. Selah.","9":"Doe thou to them as vnto the Midianites: as to Sisera and as to Iabin at the riuer of Kishon.","10":"They perished at En-dor, and were dung for the earth.","11":"Make them, euen their princes like Oreb and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes like Zebah and like Zalmuna.","12":"Which haue said, Let vs take for our possession the habitations of God.","13":"O my God, make them like vnto a wheele, and as the stubble before the winde.","14":"As the fire burneth the forest, and as the flame setteth the mountaines on fire:","15":"So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraide with thy storme.","16":"Fill their faces with shame, that they may seeke thy Name, O Lord.","17":"Let them be confounded and troubled for euer: yea, let them be put to shame and perish,","18":"That they may knowe that thou, which art called Iehouah, art alone, euen the most High ouer all the earth."}
