{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. I will sing mercie and iudgement: vnto thee, O Lord, will I sing.","2":"I will doe wisely in the perfite way, till thou commest to me: I will walke in the vprightnes of mine heart in the middes of mine house.","3":"I wil set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the worke of them that fall away: it shal not cleaue vnto me.","4":"A froward heart shall depart from me: I will knowe none euill.","5":"Him that priuily slandereth his neighbour, wil I destroy: him that hath a proude looke and hie heart, I cannot suffer.","6":"Mine eyes shalbe vnto the faithfull of the lande, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfite way, he shall serue me.","7":"There shal no deceitful person dwell within mine house: he that telleth lyes, shall not remaine in my sight.","8":"Betimes will I destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all the workers of iniquitie from the Citie of the Lord."}
