{"1":"A song of degrees. Blessed is euery one that feareth the Lorde and walketh in his wayes.","2":"When thou eatest the labours of thine hands, thou shalt be blessed, and it shall be well with thee.","3":"Thy wife shalbe as the fruitfull vine on the sides of thine house, and thy children like the oliue plantes round about thy table.","4":"Lo, surely thus shall the man be blessed, that feareth the Lord.","5":"The Lorde out of Zion shall blesse thee, and thou shalt see the wealth of Ierusalem all the dayes of thy life.","6":"Yea, thou shalt see thy childrens children, and peace vpon Israel."}
