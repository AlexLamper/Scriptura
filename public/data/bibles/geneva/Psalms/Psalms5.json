{"1":"To him that excelleth vpon Nehiloth. A Psalme of Dauid. Heare my wordes, O Lorde: vnderstande my meditation.","2":"Hearken vnto the voyce of my crie, my King and my God: for vnto thee doe I pray.","3":"Heare my voyce in the morning, O Lorde: for in the morning will I direct me vnto thee, and I will waite.","4":"For thou art not a God that loueth wickednes: neither shall euill dwell with thee.","5":"The foolish shal not stand in thy sight: for thou hatest all them that worke iniquitie.","6":"Thou shalt destroy them that speake lyes: the Lorde will abhorre the bloodie man and deceitfull.","7":"But I wil come into thine house in the multitude of thy mercie: and in thy feare will I worship toward thine holy Temple.","8":"Leade me, O Lord, in thy righteousnes, because of mine enemies: make thy way plaine before my face.","9":"For no constancie is in their mouth: within, they are very corruption: their throte is an open sepulchre, and they flatter with their tongue.","10":"Destroy them, O God: let them fall from their counsels: cast them out for the multitude of their iniquities, because they haue rebelled against thee.","11":"And let all them that trust in thee, reioyce and triumph for euer, and couer thou them: and let them, that loue thy Name, reioyce in thee.","12":"For thou Lorde wilt blesse the righteous, and with fauour wilt compasse him, as with a shielde."}
