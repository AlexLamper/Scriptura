{"1":"A song of degrees or Psalme of Dauid. Beholde, howe good and howe comely a thing it is, brethren to dwell euen together.","2":"It is like to the precious oyntment vpon the head, that runneth downe vpon the beard, euen vnto Aarons beard, which went downe on the border of his garments:","3":"And as the dew of Hermon, which falleth vpon the mountaines of Zion: for there the Lord appointed the blessing and life for euer."}
