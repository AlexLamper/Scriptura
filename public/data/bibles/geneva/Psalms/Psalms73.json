{"1":"A Psalme committed to Asaph. Yet God is good to Israel: euen, to the pure in heart.","2":"As for me, my feete were almost gone: my steps had welneere slipt.","3":"For I feared at the foolish, when I sawe the prosperitie of the wicked.","4":"For there are no bandes in their death, but they are lustie and strong.","5":"They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued with other men.","6":"Therefore pride is as a chayne vnto them, and crueltie couereth them as a garment.","7":"Their eyes stande out for fatnesse: they haue more then heart can wish.","8":"They are licentious, and speake wickedly of their oppression: they talke presumptuously.","9":"They set their mouth against heauen, and their tongue walketh through the earth.","10":"Therefore his people turne hither: for waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.","11":"And they say, Howe doeth God know it? or is there knowledge in the most High?","12":"Lo, these are the wicked, yet prosper they alway, and increase in riches.","13":"Certainely I haue clensed mine heart in vaine, and washed mine hands in innocencie.","14":"For dayly haue I bene punished, and chastened euery morning.","15":"If I say, I will iudge thus, beholde the generation of thy children: I haue trespassed.","16":"Then thought I to know this, but it was too painefull for me,","17":"Vntill I went into the Sanctuarie of God: then vnderstoode I their ende.","18":"Surely thou hast set them in slipperie places, and castest them downe into desolation.","19":"How suddenly are they destroyed, perished and horribly consumed,","20":"As a dreame when one awaketh! O Lord, when thou raisest vs vp, thou shalt make their image despised.","21":"Certainely mine heart was vexed, and I was pricked in my reines:","22":"So foolish was I & ignorant: I was a beast before thee.","23":"Yet I was alway with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.","24":"Thou wilt guide me by thy counsell, and afterward receiue me to glory.","25":"Whom haue I in heauen but thee? and I haue desired none in the earth with thee.","26":"My flesh fayleth and mine heart also: but God is the strength of mine heart, and my portion for euer.","27":"For loe, they that withdrawe themselues from thee, shall perish: thou destroyest all them that goe a whoring from thee.","28":"As for me, it is good for me to draw neere to God: therefore I haue put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy workes."}
