O God, mine heart is prepared, so is my tongue: I will sing and giue praise.","2":"Awake viole and harpe: I will awake early.","3":"I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people, and I wil sing vnto thee among the nations.","4":"For thy mercy is great aboue the heauens, and thy trueth vnto the clouds.","5":"Exalt thy self, O God, aboue the heauens, and let thy glorie be vpon all the earth,","6":"That thy beloued may be deliuered: helpe with thy right hand and heare me.","7":"God hath spoken in his holinesse: therefore I will reioyce, I shall deuide Shechem and measure the valley of Succoth.","8":"Gilead shalbe mine, and Manasseh shalbe mine: Ephraim also shalbe the strength of mine head: Iuda is my lawgiuer.","9":"Moab shalbe my washpot: ouer Edom wil I cast out my shoe: vpon Palestina wil I triumph.","10":"Who will leade mee into the strong citie? Who will bring me vnto Edom?","11":"Wilt not thou, O God, which haddest forsaken vs, and diddest not goe foorth, O God, with our armies?","12":"Giue vs helpe against trouble: for vaine is the helpe of man.","13":"Through God we shall doe valiantly: for he shall treade downe our enemies."}
