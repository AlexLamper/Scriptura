{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. I will praise thee with my whole heart: euen before the gods will I praise thee.","2":"I will worship toward thine holy Temple and praise thy Name, because of thy louing kindenesse and for thy trueth: for thou hast magnified thy Name aboue all things by thy word.","3":"When I called, then thou heardest me, and hast encreased strength in my soule.","4":"All the Kings of the earth shal praise thee, O Lorde: for they haue heard the wordes of thy mouth.","5":"And they shall sing of the wayes of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord is great.","6":"For the Lord is high: yet he beholdeth the lowly, but the proude he knoweth afarre off.","7":"Though I walke in the middes of trouble, yet wilt thou reuiue me: thou wilt stretch foorth thine hand vpon the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall saue me.","8":"The Lord will performe his worke toward me: O Lorde, thy mercie endureth for euer: forsake not the workes of thine handes."}
