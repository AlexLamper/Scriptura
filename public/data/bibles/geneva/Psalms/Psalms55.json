{"1":"To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of Dauid to giue instruction. Heare my prayer, O God, and hide not thy selfe from my supplication.","2":"Hearken vnto me, & answere me: I mourne in my prayer, and make a noyse,","3":"For the voyce of the enemie, and for the vexation of ye wicked, because they haue brought iniquitie vpon me, and furiously hate me.","4":"Mine heart trembleth within mee, and the terrours of death are fallen vpon me.","5":"Feare and trembling are come vpon mee, and an horrible feare hath couered me.","6":"And I said, Oh that I had wings like a doue: then would I flie away and rest.","7":"Beholde, I woulde take my flight farre off, and lodge in the wildernes. Selah.","8":"Hee would make haste for my deliuerance from the stormie winde and tempest.","9":"Destroy, O Lord, and deuide their tongues: for I haue seene crueltie and strife in the citie.","10":"Day and night they goe about it vpon the walles thereof: both iniquitie and mischiefe are in the middes of it.","11":"Wickednes is in the middes thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streetes.","12":"Surely mine enemie did not defame mee: for I could haue borne it: neither did mine aduersarie exalt himselfe against mee: for I would haue hid me from him.","13":"But it was thou, O man, euen my companion, my guide and my familiar:","14":"Which delited in consulting together, and went into the House of God as companions.","15":"Let death sense vpon them: let them goe downe quicke into the graue: for wickednes is in their dwellings, euen in the middes of them.","16":"But I will call vnto God, and the Lord will saue me.","17":"Euening and morning, and at noone will I pray, and make a noyse, & he wil heare my voice.","18":"He hath deliuered my soule in peace fro the battel, that was against me: for many were with me.","19":"God shall heare and afflict them, euen hee that reigneth of olde, Selah. because they haue no changes, therefore they feare not God.","20":"Hee layed his hande vpon such, as be at peace with him, and he brake his couenant.","21":"The wordes of his mouth were softer then butter, yet warre was in his heart: his words were more gentle then oyle, yet they were swordes.","22":"Cast thy burden vpon the Lorde, and hee shall nourish thee: he wil not suffer the righteous to fall for euer.","23":"And thou, O God, shalt bring them downe into the pitte of corruption: the bloudie, and deceitfull men shall not liue halfe their dayes: but I will trust in thee."}
