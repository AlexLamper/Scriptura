{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid, when he fled from his sonne Absalom. Lorde, howe are mine aduersaries increased? howe many rise against me?","2":"Many say to my soule, There is no helpe for him in God. Selah.","3":"But thou Lorde art a buckler for me: my glory, and the lifter vp of mine head.","4":"I did call vnto the Lord with my voyce, & he heard me out of his holy mountaine. Selah.","5":"I layed me downe and slept, and rose vp againe: for the Lord susteined me.","6":"I will not be afrayde for ten thousand of the people, that should beset me round about.","7":"O Lord, arise: helpe me, my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies vpon the cheeke bone: thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.","8":"Saluation belongeth vnto the Lorde, and thy blessing is vpon thy people. Selah."}
