{"1":"A song of degrees. They haue often times afflicted me from my youth (may Israel nowe say)","2":"They haue often times afflicted me fro my youth: but they could not preuaile against me.","3":"The plowers plowed vpon my backe, and made long furrowes.","4":"But the righteous Lorde hath cut the cordes of the wicked.","5":"They that hate Zion, shalbe all ashamed and turned backward.","6":"They shalbe as the grasse on the house tops, which withereth afore it commeth forth.","7":"Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, neither the glainer his lap:","8":"Neither they, which go by, say, The blessing of the Lord be vpon you, or, We blesse you in the Name of the Lord."}
