{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid, when he changed his behauiour before Abimelech, who droue him away, and he departed. I will alway giue thankes vnto the Lorde: his praise shalbe in my mouth continually.","2":"My soule shall glory in the Lord: the humble shall heare it, and be glad.","3":"Praise ye the Lord with me, and let vs magnifie his Name together.","4":"I sought the Lord, and he heard me: yea, he deliuered me out of all my feare.","5":"They shall looke vnto him, and runne to him: and their faces shall not be ashamed, saying,","6":"This poore man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and saued him out of all his troubles.","7":"The Angel of the Lorde pitcheth round about them, that feare him, and deliuereth them.","8":"Taste ye and see, howe gratious the Lorde is: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.","9":"Feare the Lord, ye his Saintes: for nothing wanteth to them that feare him.","10":"The lyons doe lacke and suffer hunger, but they, which seeke the Lord, shall want nothing that is good.","11":"Come children, hearken vnto me: I will teache you the feare of the Lord.","12":"What man is he, that desireth life, and loueth long dayes for to see good?","13":"Keepe thy tongue from euill, and thy lips, that they speake no guile.","14":"Eschewe euill and doe good: seeke peace and followe after it.","15":"The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open vnto their crie.","16":"But the face of the Lord is against them that doe euill, to cut off their remembrance from the earth.","17":"The righteous crie, and the Lorde heareth them, and deliuereth them out of all their troubles.","18":"The Lord is neere vnto them that are of a contrite heart, and will saue such as be afflicted in Spirite.","19":"Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord deliuereth him out of them all.","20":"He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.","21":"But malice shal slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous, shall perish.","22":"The Lord redeemeth the soules of his seruants: and none, that trust in him, shall perish."}
