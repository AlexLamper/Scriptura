{"1":"To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of Dauid. Heare my cry, O God: giue eare vnto my prayer.","2":"From the endes of the earth will I crye vnto thee: when mine heart is opprest, bring me vpon the rocke that is higher then I.","3":"For thou hast bene mine hope, and a strong tower against the enemie.","4":"I will dwell in thy Tabernacle for euer, and my trust shall be vnder the couering of thy wings. Selah.","5":"For thou, O God, hast heard my desires: thou hast giuen an heritage vnto those that feare thy Name.","6":"Thou shalt giue the King a long life: his yeeres shalbe as many ages.","7":"Hee shall dwell before God for euer: prepare mercie and faithfulnes that they may preserue him.","8":"So will I alway sing prayse vnto thy Name in performing dayly my vowes."}
