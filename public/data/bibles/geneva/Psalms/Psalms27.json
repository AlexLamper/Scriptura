{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. The Lord is my light & my saluation, whom shall I feare? the Lorde is the strength of my life, of whome shall I be afraide?","2":"When the wicked, euen mine enemies and my foes came vpon mee to eate vp my flesh; they stumbled and fell.","3":"Though an hoste pitched against me, mine heart should not be afraide: though warre be raised against me, I will trust in this.","4":"One thing haue I desired of the Lorde, that I will require, euen that I may dwell in the house of the Lorde all the dayes of my life, to beholde the beautie of the Lorde, and to visite his Temple.","5":"For in the time of trouble hee shall hide mee in his Tabernacle: in the secrete place of his pauillion shall he hide me, and set me vp vpon a rocke.","6":"And nowe shall hee lift vp mine head aboue mine enemies rounde about mee: therefore wil I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of ioy: I wil sing and praise the Lord.","7":"Hearken vnto my voyce, O Lorde, when I crie: haue mercie also vpon mee and heare mee.","8":"When thou saidest, Seeke ye my face, mine heart answered vnto thee, O Lorde, I will seeke thy face.","9":"Hide not therefore thy face from mee, nor cast thy seruat away in displeasure: thou hast bene my succour: leaue me not, neither forsake mee, O God of my saluation.","10":"Though my father and my mother shoulde forsake me, yet the Lorde will gather me vp.","11":"Teache mee thy way, O Lorde, and leade me in a right path, because of mine enemies.","12":"Giue me not vnto the lust of mine aduersaries: for there are false witnesses risen vp against me, and such as speake cruelly.","13":"I should haue fainted, except I had beleeued to see the goodnes of the Lord in the land of the liuing.","14":"Hope in the Lord: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart, and trust in the Lord."}
