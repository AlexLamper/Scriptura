{"1":"A Psalme or song of the dedication of the house of Dauid. I will magnifie thee, O Lorde: for thou hast exalted mee, and hast not made my foe to reioyce ouer me.","2":"O Lorde my God, I cried vnto thee, and thou hast restored me.","3":"O Lorde, thou hast brought vp my soule out of the graue: thou hast reuiued me from them that goe downe into the pit.","4":"Sing praises vnto the Lord, ye his Saintes, and giue thankes before the remembrance of his Holinesse.","5":"For he endureth but a while in his anger: but in his fauour is life: weeping may abide at euening, but ioy commeth in the morning.","6":"And in my prosperitie I sayde, I shall neuer be moued.","7":"For thou Lord of thy goodnes hadest made my mountaine to stande strong: but thou didest hide thy face, and I was troubled.","8":"Then cried I vnto thee, O Lord, and praied to my Lord.","9":"What profite is there in my blood, when I go downe to the pit? shall the dust giue thankes vnto thee? or shall it declare thy trueth?","10":"Heare, O Lorde, and haue mercy vpon me: Lord, be thou mine helper.","11":"Thou hast turned my mourning into ioy: thou hast loosed my sacke and girded mee with gladnesse.","12":"Therefore shal my tongue praise thee and not cease: O Lorde my God, I will giue thankes vnto thee for euer."}
