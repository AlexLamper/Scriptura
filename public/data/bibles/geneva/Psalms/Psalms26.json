{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. Ivdge me, O Lorde, for I haue walked in mine innocency: my trust hath bene also in the Lord: therefore shall I not slide.","2":"Proue me, O Lorde, and trie mee: examine my reines, and mine heart.","3":"For thy louing kindnesse is before mine eyes: therefore haue I walked in thy trueth.","4":"I haue not hanted with vaine persons, neither kept companie with the dissemblers.","5":"I haue hated the assemblie of the euill, and haue not companied with the wicked.","6":"I will wash mine handes in innocencie, O Lord, and compasse thine altar,","7":"That I may declare with the voyce of thankesgiuing, and set foorth all thy wonderous woorkes.","8":"O Lorde, I haue loued the habitation of thine house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.","9":"Gather not my soule with the sinners, nor my life with the bloodie men:","10":"In whose handes is wickednes, and their right hand is full of bribes.","11":"But I will walke in mine innocencie: redeeme me therefore, and be mercifull vnto me.","12":"My foote standeth in vprightnesse: I will praise thee, O Lord, in the Congregations."}
