{"1":"The prayer of Dauid. Heare the right, O Lorde, consider my crye: hearken vnto my prayer of lips vnfained.","2":"Let my sentence come forth from thy presence, and let thine eyes beholde equitie.","3":"Thou hast prooued and visited mine heart in the night: thou hast tryed me, and foundest nothing: for I was purposed that my mouth should not offend.","4":"Concerning the workes of men, by the wordes of thy lips I kept mee from the paths of the cruell man.","5":"Stay my steps in thy paths, that my feete doe not slide.","6":"I haue called vpon thee: surely thou wilt heare me, O God: incline thine eare to me, and hearken vnto my wordes.","7":"Shewe thy marueilous mercies, thou that art the Sauiour of them that trust in thee, from such as resist thy right hand.","8":"Keepe me as the apple of the eye: hide me vnder the shadowe of thy wings,","9":"From the wicked that oppresse mee, from mine enemies, which compasse me round about for my soule.","10":"They are inclosed in their owne fat, and they haue spoken proudely with their mouth.","11":"They haue compassed vs now in our steps: they haue set their eyes to bring downe to the ground:","12":"Like as a lyon that is greedy of pray, and as it were a lyons whelp lurking in secret places.","13":"Vp Lord, disappoint him: cast him downe: deliuer my soule from the wicked with thy sworde,","14":"From men by thine hand, O Lorde, from men of the world, who haue their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thine hid treasure: their children haue ynough, and leaue the rest of their substance for their children.","15":"But I will beholde thy face in righteousnes, and when I awake, I shalbe satisfied with thine image."}
