{"1":"A song or Psalme of Heman the Ezrahite to giue instruction, committed to the sonnes of Korah for him that excelleth vpon Malath Leannoth. O Lorde God of my saluation, I cry day and night before thee.","2":"Let my prayer enter into thy presence: incline thine eare vnto my cry.","3":"For my soule is filled with euils, and my life draweth neere to the graue.","4":"I am counted among them that go downe vnto the pit, and am as a man without strength:","5":"Free among the dead, like the slaine lying in the graue, whome thou remembrest no more, and they are cut off from thine hand.","6":"Thou hast layde me in the lowest pit, in darkenes, and in the deepe.","7":"Thine indignation lyeth vpon me, & thou hast vexed me with all thy waues. Selah.","8":"Thou hast put away mine acquaintance farre from me, and made mee to be abhorred of them: I am shut vp, and cannot get foorth.","9":"Mine eye is sorowfull through mine affliction: Lorde, I call dayly vpon thee: I stretch out mine hands vnto thee.","10":"Wilt thou shewe a miracle to the dead? or shall the dead rise and prayse thee? Selah.","11":"Shall thy louing kindenes be declared in the graue? or thy faithfulnes in destruction?","12":"Shall thy wonderous workes be knowen in the darke? and thy righteousnes in the land of obliuion?","13":"But vnto thee haue I cryed, O Lorde, and early shall my prayer come before thee.","14":"Lorde, why doest thou reiect my soule, and hidest thy face from me?","15":"I am afflicted and at the point of death: from my youth I suffer thy terrours, doubting of my life.","16":"Thine indignations goe ouer me, and thy feare hath cut me off.","17":"They came round about me dayly like water, and compassed me together.","18":"My louers and friends hast thou put away from me, and mine acquaintance hid themselues."}
