{"1":"A song of degrees. I will lift mine eyes vnto the mouuntaines, from whence mine helpe shall come.","2":"Mine helpe commeth from the Lord, which hath made the heauen and the earth.","3":"He wil not suffer thy foote to slippe: for he that keepeth thee, will not slumber.","4":"Beholde, he that keepeth Israel, wil neither slumber nor sleepe.","5":"The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shadow at thy right hand.","6":"The sunne shall not smite thee by day, nor the moone by night.","7":"The Lord shall preserue thee from all euil: he shall keepe thy soule.","8":"The Lorde shall preserue thy going out, and thy comming in from henceforth & for euer."}
