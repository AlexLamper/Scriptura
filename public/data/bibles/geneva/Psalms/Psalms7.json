{"1":"Shigaion of Dauid, which he sang vnto the Lord, concerning the wordes of Chush the sonne of Iemini. O lorde my God, in thee I put my trust: saue me from all that persecute me, & deliuer me,","2":"Least he deuoure my soule like a lion, and teare it in pieces, while there is none to helpe.","3":"O Lorde my God, if I haue done this thing, if there be any wickednes in mine handes,","4":"If I haue rewarded euill vnto him that had peace with mee, (yea I haue deliuered him that vexed me without cause)","5":"Then let the enemie persecute my soule and take it: yea, let him treade my life downe vpon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.","6":"Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift vp thy selfe against the rage of mine enemies, and awake for mee according to the iudgement that thou hast appointed.","7":"So shall the Congregation of the people compasse thee about: for their sakes therefore returne on hie.","8":"The Lorde shall iudge the people: Iudge thou me, O Lorde, according to my righteousnesse, and according to mine innocencie, that is in mee.","9":"Oh let the malice of the wicked come to an ende: but guide thou the iust: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reines.","10":"My defence is in God, who preserueth the vpright in heart.","11":"God iudgeth the righteous, and him that contemneth God euery day.","12":"Except he turne, he hath whet his sword: he hath bent his bowe and made it readie.","13":"Hee hath also prepared him deadly weapons: hee will ordeine his arrowes for them that persecute me.","14":"Beholde, hee shall trauaile with wickednes: for he hath conceiued mischiefe, but he shall bring foorth a lye.","15":"Hee hath made a pitte and digged it, and is fallen into the pit that he made.","16":"His mischiefe shall returne vpon his owne head, & his crueltie shall fall vpon his owne pate.","17":"I wil praise the Lord according to his righteousnes, and will sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high."}
