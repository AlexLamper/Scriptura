{"1":"To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of Dauid, to giue instruction. Whe the Ziphims came and said vnto Saul, Is not Dauid hid among vs? Saue mee, O God, by thy Name, and by thy power iudge me.","2":"O God, heare my prayer: hearken vnto the wordes of my mouth.","3":"For strangers are risen vp against me, and tyrants seeke my soule: they haue not set God before them. Selah.","4":"Beholde, God is mine helper: the Lorde is with them that vpholde my soule.","5":"He shall rewarde euill vnto mine enemies: Oh cut them off in thy trueth!","6":"Then I will sacrifice freely vnto thee: I wil praise thy Name, O Lord, because it is good.","7":"For he hath deliuered me out of al trouble, & mine eye hath seene my desire vpo mine enemies."}
