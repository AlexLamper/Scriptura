{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. Blessed be the Lorde my strength, which teacheth mine hands to fight, and my fingers to battell.","2":"He is my goodnes and my fortresse, my towre and my deliuerer, my shield, and in him I trust, which subdueth my people vnder me.","3":"Lorde, what is man that thou regardest him! or the sonne of man that thou thinkest vpon him!","4":"Man is like to vanitie: his dayes are like a shadow, that vanisheth.","5":"Bow thine heauens, O Lorde, and come downe: touch the mountaines & they shal smoke.","6":"Cast forth the lightning & scatter them: shoote out thine arrowes, and consume them.","7":"Send thine hand from aboue: deliuer me, and take me out of the great waters, and from the hand of strangers,","8":"Whose mouth talketh vanitie, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.","9":"I wil sing a new song vnto thee, O God, and sing vnto thee vpon a viole, and an instrument of ten strings.","10":"It is he that giueth deliuerance vnto Kings, and rescueth Dauid his seruant from the hurtfull sworde.","11":"Rescue me, and deliuer me from the hand of strangers, whose mouth talketh vanitie, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehoode:","12":"That our sonnes may be as the plantes growing vp in their youth, and our daughters as the corner stones, grauen after the similitude of a palace:","13":"That our corners may be full, and abounding with diuers sorts, and that our sheepe may bring forth thousands and ten thousand in our streetes:","14":"That our oxen may be strong to labour: that there be none inuasion, nor going out, nor no crying in our streetes.","15":"Blessed are the people, that be so, yea, blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord."}
