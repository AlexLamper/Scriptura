{"1":"A song of degrees. Ovt of the deepe places haue I called vnto thee, O Lord.","2":"Lorde, heare my voyce: let thine eares attend to the voyce of my prayers.","3":"If thou, O Lord, straightly markest iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?","4":"But mercie is with thee, that thou mayest be feared.","5":"I haue waited on the Lord: my soule hath waited, and I haue trusted in his worde.","6":"My soule waiteth on the Lorde more then the morning watch watcheth for the morning.","7":"Let Israel waite on the Lorde: for with the Lorde is mercie, and with him is great redemption.","8":"And he shall redeeme Israel from all his iniquities."}
