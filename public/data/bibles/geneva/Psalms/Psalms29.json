{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. Giue vnto the Lord, ye sonnes of the mightie: giue vnto the Lord glorie and strength.","2":"Giue vnto the Lorde glorie due vnto his Name: worship the Lorde in the glorious Sanctuarie.","3":"The voyce of the Lord is vpon the waters: the God of glorie maketh it to thunder: the Lord is vpon the great waters.","4":"The voyce of the Lorde is mightie: the voyce of the Lord is glorious.","5":"The voyce of the Lorde breaketh the cedars: yea, the Lorde breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.","6":"He maketh them also to leape like a calfe: Lebanon also and Shirion like a yong vnicorne.","7":"The voice of the Lord deuideth the flames of sire.","8":"The voice of the Lord maketh the wildernes to tremble: the Lord maketh the wildernes of Kadesh to tremble.","9":"The voice of the Lord maketh the hindes to calue, & discouereth the forests: therefore in his Temple doth euery man speake of his glory.","10":"The Lord sitteth vpon the flood, and the Lord doeth remaine King for euer.","11":"The Lord shall giue strength vnto his people: the Lord shall blesse his people with peace."}
