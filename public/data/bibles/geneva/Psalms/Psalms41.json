{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. Blessed is he that iudgeth wisely of the poore: the Lord shal deliuer him in ye time of trouble.","2":"The Lord will keepe him, and preserue him aliue: he shalbe blessed vpon the earth, and thou wilt not deliuer him vnto the will of his enemies.","3":"The Lord wil stregthen him vpon ye bed of sorow: thou hast turned al his bed in his sicknes.","4":"Therefore I saide, Lorde haue mercie vpon me: heale my soule, for I haue sinned against thee.","5":"Mine enemies speake euill of me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish?","6":"And if hee come to see mee, hee speaketh lies, but his heart heapeth iniquitie within him, and when he commeth foorth, he telleth it.","7":"All they that hate me, whisper together against me: euen against me do they imagine mine hurt.","8":"A mischiefe is light vpon him, and he that lyeth, shall no more rise.","9":"Yea, my familiar friend, whom I trusted, which did eate of my bread, hath lifted vp the heele against me.","10":"Therefore, O Lord, haue mercy vpon mee, and raise me vp: so I shall reward them.","11":"By this I know that thou fauourest me, because mine enemie doth not triumph against me.","12":"And as for me, thou vpholdest me in mine integritie, & doest set me before thy face for euer.","13":"Blessed be the Lorde God of Israel worlde without ende. So be it, euen so be it."}
