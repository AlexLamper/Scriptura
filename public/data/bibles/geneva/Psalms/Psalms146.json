{"1":"Prayse ye the Lorde. Prayse thou the Lord, O my soule.","2":"I will prayse the Lorde during my life: as long as I haue any being, I wil sing vnto my God.","3":"Put not your trust in princes, nor in the sonne of man, for there is none helpe in him.","4":"His breath departeth, and he returneth to his earth: then his thoughtes perish.","5":"Blessed is he, that hath the God of Iaakob for his helpe, whose hope is in the Lord his God.","6":"Which made heauen and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth his fidelitie for euer:","7":"Which executeth iustice for the oppressed: which giueth bread to the hungry: the Lord loseth the prisoners.","8":"The Lorde giueth sight to the blinde: the Lord rayseth vp the crooked: the Lord loueth the righteous.","9":"The Lord keepeth the strangers: he relieueth the fatherlesse & widowe: but he ouerthroweth the way of the wicked.","10":"The Lord shall reigne for euer: O Zion, thy God endureth from generation to generation. Prayse ye the Lord."}
