Blessed is the man, that feareth the Lord, and deliteth greatly in his commandements.","2":"His seede shall be mightie vpon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.","3":"Riches and treasures shalbe in his house, and his righteousnesse endureth for euer.","4":"Vnto the righteous ariseth light in darkenes: he is merciful & full of copassion & righteous.","5":"A good man is mercifull and lendeth, and will measure his affaires by iudgement.","6":"Surely he shall neuer be moued: but the righteous shalbe had in euerlasting remembrance.","7":"He will not be afraide of euill tidings: for his heart is fixed, and beleeueth in the Lord.","8":"His heart is stablished: therefore he will not feare, vntill he see his desire vpon his enemies.","9":"He hath distributed and giuen to ye poore: his righteousnesse remaineth for euer: his horne shalbe exalted with glory.","10":"The wicked shall see it and be angrie: he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the wicked shall perish."}
