{"1":"Why standest thou farre off, O Lorde, and hidest thee in due time, euen in afflictio?","2":"The wicked with pride doeth persecute the poore: let them be taken in the craftes that they haue imagined.","3":"For the wicked hath made boast of his owne heartes desire, and the couetous blesseth himselfe: he contemneth the Lord.","4":"The wicked is so proude that hee seeketh not for God: hee thinketh alwayes, There is no God.","5":"His wayes alway prosper: thy iudgements are hie aboue his sight: therefore defieth he all his enemies.","6":"He saith in his heart, I shall neuer be moued, nor be in danger.","7":"His mouth is full of cursing and deceite and fraude: vnder his tongue is mischiefe and iniquitie.","8":"He lieth in waite in the villages: in the secret places doeth hee murther the innocent: his eyes are bent against the poore.","9":"He lyeth in waite secretly, euen as a lyon in his denne: he lyeth in waite to spoyle the poore: he doeth spoyle the poore, when he draweth him into his net.","10":"He croucheth and boweth: therefore heaps of the poore doe fall by his might.","11":"He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten, he hideth away his face, and will neuer see.","12":"Arise, O Lorde God: lift vp thine hande: forget not the poore.","13":"Wherefore doeth the wicked contemne God? he saith in his heart, Thou wilt not regard.","14":"Yet thou hast seene it: for thou beholdest mischiefe and wrong, that thou mayest take it into thine handes: the poore committeth himselfe vnto thee: for thou art the helper of the fatherlesse.","15":"Breake thou the arme of the wicked and malicious: searche his wickednes, and thou shalt finde none.","16":"The Lorde is King for euer and euer: the heathen are destroyed foorth of his land.","17":"Lorde, thou hast heard the desire of the poore: thou preparest their heart: thou bendest thine eare to them,","18":"To iudge the fatherlesse and poore, that earthly man cause to feare no more."}
