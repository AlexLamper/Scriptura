{"1":"A song of degrees, or Psalme of Dauid. If the Lord had not bene on our side, (may Israel now say)","2":"If the Lord had not bene on our side, when men rose vp against vs,","3":"They had then swallowed vs vp quicke, when their wrath was kindled against vs.","4":"Then the waters had drowned vs, and the streame had gone ouer our soule:","5":"Then had the swelling waters gone ouer our soule.","6":"Praysed be the Lord, which hath not giuen vs as a praye vnto their teeth.","7":"Our soule is escaped, euen as a bird out of the snare of the foulers: the snare is broken, and we are deliuered.","8":"Our helpe is in the Name of the Lorde, which hath made heauen and earth."}
