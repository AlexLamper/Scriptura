{"1":"A Psalme to giue instruction comitted to Asaph. Heare my doctrine, O my people: incline your eares vnto the wordes of my mouth.","2":"I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare high sentences of olde.","3":"Which we haue heard and knowen, & our fathers haue tolde vs.","4":"Wee will not hide them from their children but to the generation to come we wil shewe the praises of the Lord his power also, & his wonderful woorkes that he hath done:","5":"How he established a testimonie in Iaakob, and ordeined a Law in Israel, which he commaunded our fathers, that they shoulde teache their children:","6":"That the posteritie might knowe it, and the children, which should be borne, should stand vp, and declare it to their children:","7":"That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the workes of God but keepe his commandements:","8":"And not to bee as their fathers, a disobedient & rebellious generation: a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirite was not faithfull vnto God.","9":"The children of Ephraim being armed and shooting with the bowe, turned backe in the day of battell.","10":"They kept not the couenant of God, but refused to walke in his Lawe,","11":"And forgate his Actes, and his wonderfull woorkes that he had shewed them.","12":"Hee did marueilous thinges in the sight of their fathers in the lande of Egypt: euen in the fielde of Zoan.","13":"He deuided the Sea, & led them through: he made also the waters to stand as an heape.","14":"In the day time also hee led them with a cloude, and all the night with a light of fire.","15":"He claue the rockes in the wildernes, and gaue them drinke as of the great depths.","16":"He brought floods also out of the stonie rocke; so that hee made the waters to descend like the riuers.","17":"Yet they sinned stil against him, and prouoked the Highest in the wildernesse,","18":"And tempted God in their heartes in requiring meate for their lust.","19":"They spake against God also, saying, Can God prepare a table in the wildernesse?","20":"Behold, he smote the rocke, that the water gushed out, and the streames ouerflowed: can hee giue bread also? or prepare flesh for his people?","21":"Therefore the Lord heard and was angrie, and the fire was kindled in Iaakob, & also wrath came vpon Israel,","22":"Because they beleeued not in God, and trusted not in his helpe.","23":"Yet he had comanded the clouds aboue, and had opened the doores of heauen,","24":"And had rained downe MAN vpon them for to eate, and had giuen them of the wheate of heauen.","25":"Man did eate the bread of Angels: hee sent them meate ynough.","26":"He caused the Eastwinde to passe in the heauen, and through his power he brought in the Southwinde.","27":"Hee rained flesh also vpon them as dust, and feathered foule as the sand of the sea.","28":"And hee made it fall in the middes of their campe euen round about their habitations.","29":"So they did eate and were well filled: for he gaue them their desire.","30":"They were not turned from their lust, but the meate was yet in their mouthes,","31":"When the wrath of God came euen vpon them, and slew the strongest of them, and smote downe the chosen men in Israel.","32":"For all this, they sinned stil, and beleeued not his wonderous woorkes.","33":"Therefore their daies did hee consume in vanitie, and their yeeres hastily.","34":"And when hee slewe them, they sought him and they returned, and sought God earely.","35":"And they remembred that God was their strength, and the most high God their redeemer.","36":"But they flattered him with their mouth, and dissembled with him with their tongue.","37":"For their heart was not vpright with him: neither were they faithfull in his couenant.","38":"Yet he being merciful forgaue their iniquitie, & destroied them not, but oft times called backe his anger, & did not stirre vp all his wrath.","39":"For he remebred that they were flesh: yea, a winde that passeth and commeth not againe.","40":"How oft did they prouoke him in the wildernes? and grieue him in the desert?","41":"Yea, they returned, & tempted God, and limited the Holie one of Israel.","42":"They remebred not his hand, nor the day when he deliuered them from the enemie,","43":"Nor him that set his signes in Egypt, and his wonders in the fielde of Zoan,","44":"And turned their riuers into blood, & their floods, that they could not drinke.","45":"Hee sent a swarme of flies among them, which deuoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.","46":"He gaue also their fruites vnto the caterpiller, and their labour vnto the grassehopper.","47":"He destroied their vines with haile, & their wilde figge trees with the hailestone.","48":"He gaue their cattell also to the haile, and their flockes to the thunderboltes.","49":"Hee cast vpon them the fiercenesse of his anger, indignation and wrath, and vexation by the sending out of euill Angels.","50":"He made a way to his anger: he spared not their soule from death, but gaue their life to the pestilence,","51":"And smote al the firstborne in Egypt, euen the beginning of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham.","52":"But hee made his people to goe out like sheepe, & led them in the wildernes like a flocke.","53":"Yea, he caried them out safely, and they feared not, and the Sea couered their enemies.","54":"And he brought them vnto the borders of his Sanctuarie: euen to this Mountaine, which his right hand purchased.","55":"He cast out the heathe also before them, and caused them to fall to the lot of his inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.","56":"Yet they tempted, and prouoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies,","57":"But turned backe & delt falsely like their fathers: they turned like a deceitfull bowe.","58":"And they prouoked him to anger with their high places, and mooued him to wrath with their grauen images.","59":"God heard this and was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel,","60":"So that hee forsooke the habitation of Shilo, euen the Tabernacle where hee dwelt among men,","61":"And deliuered his power into captiuitie, and his beautie into the enemies hand.","62":"And hee gaue vp his people to the sworde, and was angrie with his inheritance.","63":"The fire deuoured their chosen men, and their maides were not praised.","64":"Their Priestes fell by the sworde, and their widowes lamented not.","65":"But the Lord awaked as one out of sleepe, & as a strong man that after his wine crieth out,","66":"And smote his enemies in the hinder parts, and put them to a perpetuall shame.","67":"Yet he refused the tabernacle of Ioseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:","68":"But chose the tribe of Iudah, and mount Zion which he loued.","69":"And he built his Sanctuarie as an high palace, like the earth, which he stablished for euer.","70":"He chose Dauid also his seruant, and tooke him from the shepefolds.","71":"Euen from behinde the ewes with yong brought he him to feede his people in Iaakob, and his inheritance in Israel.","72":"So he fed them according to the simplicitie of his heart, and guided them by the discretion of his hands."}
