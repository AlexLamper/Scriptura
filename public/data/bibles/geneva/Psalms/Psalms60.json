{"1":"To him that excelleth vpon Shushan Eduth, or Michtam. A Psalme of Dauid to teach. When he fought against Aram Naharaim, & against Aram Zobah, when Ioab returned and slewe twelue thousand Edomites in the salt valley. O God, thou hast cast vs out, thou hast scattered vs, thou hast bene angry, turne againe vnto vs.","2":"Thou hast made the land to tremble, and hast made it to gape: heale the breaches thereof, for it is shaken.","3":"Thou hast shewed thy people heauy things: thou hast made vs to drinke the wine of giddines.","4":"But now thou hast giuen a banner to them that feare thee, that it may be displayed because of thy trueth. Selah.","5":"That thy beloued may be deliuered, helpe with thy right hand and heare me.","6":"God hath spoken in his holines: therefore I will reioyce: I shall deuide Shechem, and measure the valley of Succoth.","7":"Gilead shalbe mine, and Manasseh shalbe mine: Ephraim also shalbe the strength of mine head: Iudah is my lawgiuer.","8":"Moab shalbe my wash pot: ouer Edom will I cast out my shoe: Palestina shew thy selfe ioyfull for me.","9":"Who will leade me into the strong citie? who will bring me vnto Edom?","10":"Wilt not thou, O God, which hadest cast vs off, & didest not go forth, O God, with our armies?","11":"Giue vs helpe against trouble: for vaine is the helpe of man.","12":"Through God we shall doe valiantly: for he shall tread downe our enemies."}
