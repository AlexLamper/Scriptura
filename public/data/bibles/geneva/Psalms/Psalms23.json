{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. The Lorde is my shephearde, I shall not want.","2":"He maketh me to rest in greene pasture, and leadeth me by the still waters.","3":"He restoreth my soule, and leadeth me in the paths of righteousnesse for his Names sake.","4":"Yea, though I should walke through the valley of the shadowe of death, I will feare no euill: for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staffe, they comfort me.","5":"Thou doest prepare a table before me in the sight of mine aduersaries: thou doest anoynt mine head with oyle, and my cuppe runneth ouer.","6":"Doubtlesse kindnesse and mercie shall followe me all the dayes of my life, and I shall remaine a long season in the house of the Lord."}
