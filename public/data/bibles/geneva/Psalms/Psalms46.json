{"1":"To him that excelleth vpon Alamoth a song committed to the sonnes of Korah. God is our hope and strength, and helpe in troubles, ready to be found.","2":"Therefore will not we feare, though the earth be moued, and though the mountaines fall into the middes of the sea.","3":"Though the waters thereof rage and be troubled, and the mountaines shake at the surges of the same. Selah,","4":"Yet there is a Riuer, whose streames shall make glad the citie of God: euen the Sanctuarie of the Tabernacles of the most High.","5":"God is in the middes of it: therefore shall it not be moued: God shall helpe it very earely.","6":"When the nations raged, and the kingdomes were moued, God thundred, and the earth melted.","7":"The Lord of hostes is with vs: the God of Iaakob is our refuge. Selah.","8":"Come, and behold the workes of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.","9":"He maketh warres to cease vnto the endes of the world: he breaketh the bowe and cutteth the speare, and burneth the chariots with fire.","10":"Be still and knowe that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I wil be exalted in the earth.","11":"The Lord of hostes is with vs: the God of Iaakob is our refuge. Selah."}
