Selah.","7":"Heare, O my people, and I wil speake: heare, O Israel, and I wil testifie vnto thee: for I am God, euen thy God.","8":"I wil not reproue thee for thy sacrifices, or thy burnt offerings, that haue not bene continually before me.","9":"I will take no bullocke out of thine house, nor goates out of thy foldes.","10":"For all the beastes of the forest are mine, and the beastes on a thousand mountaines.","11":"I knowe all the foules on the mountaines: and the wilde beastes of the fielde are mine.","12":"If I bee hungry, I will not tell thee: for the world is mine, and all that therein is.","13":"Will I eate the flesh of bulles? or drinke the blood of goates?","14":"Offer vnto God praise, and pay thy vowes vnto the most High,","15":"And call vpon me in the day of trouble: so will I deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.","16":"But vnto the wicked said God, What hast thou to doe to declare mine ordinances, that thou shouldest take my couenant in thy mouth,","17":"Seeing thou hatest to bee reformed, and hast cast my wordes behinde thee?","18":"For when thou seest a thiefe, thou runnest with him, & thou art partaker with the adulterers.","19":"Thou giuest thy mouth to euill, and with thy tongue thou forgest deceit.","20":"Thou sittest, and speakest against thy brother, and slanderest thy mothers sonne.","21":"These things hast thou done, and I held my tongue: therefore thou thoughtest that I was like thee: but I will reproue thee, and set them in order before thee.","22":"Oh cosider this, ye that forget God, least I teare you in pieces, & there be none that can deliuer you.","23":"He that offereth praise, shall glorifie mee: and to him, that disposeth his way aright, will I shew the saluation of God."}
