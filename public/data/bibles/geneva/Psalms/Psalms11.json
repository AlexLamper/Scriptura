{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. In the Lorde put I my trust: howe say yee then to my soule, Flee to your mountaine as a birde?","2":"For loe, the wicked bende their bowe, and make readie their arrowes vpon the string, that they may secretly shoote at them, which are vpright in heart.","3":"For the foundations are cast downe: what hath the righteous done?","4":"The Lord is in his holy palace: the Lordes throne is in the heauen: his eyes wil consider: his eye lids will try the children of men.","5":"The Lorde will try the righteous: but the wicked and him that loueth iniquitie, doeth his soule hate.","6":"Vpon the wicked he shal raine snares, fire, and brimstone, and stormie tempest: this is the porcion of their cup.","7":"For the righteous Lorde loueth righteousnes: his countenance doeth beholde the iust."}
