{"1":"To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme or song committed to Asaph. God is knowen in Iudah: his Name is great in Israel.","2":"For in Shalem is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Zion.","3":"There brake he the arrowes of the bowe, the shielde and the sword and the battell. Selah.","4":"Thou art more bright and puissant, then the mountaines of pray.","5":"The stout hearted are spoyled: they haue slept their sleepe, and all the men of strength haue not found their hands.","6":"At thy rebuke, O God of Iaakob, both the chariot and horse are cast a sleepe.","7":"Thou, euen thou art to be feared: and who shall stand in thy sight, when thou art angrie!","8":"Thou didest cause thy iudgement to bee heard from heauen: therefore the earth feared and was still,","9":"When thou, O God, arose to iudgement, to helpe all the meeke of the earth. Selah.","10":"Surely the rage of man shall turne to thy praise: the remnant of the rage shalt thou restrayne.","11":"Vowe and performe vnto the Lorde your God, all ye that be rounde about him: let them bring presents vnto him that ought to be feared.","12":"He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the Kings of the earth."}
