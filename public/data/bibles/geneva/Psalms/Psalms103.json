{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. My soule, prayse thou the Lorde, and all that is within me, prayse his holy Name.","2":"My soule, prayse thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefites.","3":"Which forgiueth all thine iniquitie, and healeth all thine infirmities.","4":"Which redeemeth thy life from the graue, and crowneth thee with mercy and compassions.","5":"Which satisfieth thy mouth with good things: and thy youth is renued like the eagles.","6":"The Lord executeth righteousnes & iudgement to all that are oppressed.","7":"He made his wayes knowen vnto Moses, and his workes vnto the children of Israel.","8":"The Lord is full of compassion and mercie, slowe to anger and of great kindnesse.","9":"He will not alway chide, neither keepe his anger for euer.","10":"He hath not dealt with vs after our sinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities.","11":"For as high as the heauen is aboue ye earth, so great is his mercie toward them that feare him.","12":"As farre as the East is from the West: so farre hath he remooued our sinnes from vs.","13":"As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that feare him.","14":"For he knoweth whereof we be made: he remembreth that we are but dust.","15":"The dayes of man are as grasse: as a flowre of the fielde, so florisheth he.","16":"For the winde goeth ouer it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall knowe it no more.","17":"But the louing kindnesse of the Lord endureth for euer and euer vpon them that feare him, and his righteousnes vpon childrens children,","18":"Vnto them that keepe his couenant, and thinke vpon his commandements to doe them.","19":"The Lord hath prepared his throne in heauen, and his Kingdome ruleth ouer all.","20":"Prayse the Lord, ye his Angels, that excell in strength, that doe his commandement in obeying the voyce of his worde.","21":"Prayse the Lord, all ye his hostes, ye his seruants that doe his pleasure.","22":"Prayse the Lord, all ye his workes, in all places of his dominion: my soule, prayse thou the Lorde."}
