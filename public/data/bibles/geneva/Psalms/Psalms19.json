{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The heauens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth ye worke of his hands.","2":"Day vnto day vttereth the same, & night vnto night teacheth knowledge.","3":"There is no speach nor language, where their voyce is not heard.","4":"Their line is gone forth through all the earth, & their words into the endes of the world: in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sunne.","5":"Which commeth forth as a bridegrome out of his chamber, and reioyceth like a mightie man to runne his race.","6":"His going out is from the ende of the heauen, and his compasse is vnto the endes of ye same, and none is hid from the heate thereof.","7":"The Lawe of the Lord is perfite, conuerting the soule: the testimonie of the Lord is sure, and giueth wisedome vnto the simple.","8":"The statutes of the Lorde are right and reioyce the heart: the commandement of the Lord is pure, and giueth light vnto the eyes.","9":"The feare of the Lorde is cleane, and indureth for euer: the iudgements of the Lorde are trueth: they are righteous altogether,","10":"And more to be desired then golde, yea, then much fine golde: sweeter also then honie and the honie combe.","11":"Moreouer by them is thy seruant made circumspect, and in keeping of them there is great reward.","12":"Who can vnderstand his faultes? clense me from secret fautes.","13":"Keepe thy seruant also from presumptuous sinnes: let them not reigne ouer me: so shall I be vpright, & made cleane fro much wickednes.","14":"Let the wordes of my mouth, and the meditation of mine heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer."}
