{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. Vnto thee, O Lorde, lift I vp my soule.","2":"My God, I trust in thee: let me not be confounded: let not mine enemies reioyce ouer mee.","3":"So all that hope in thee, shall not be ashamed: but let them be confounded, that transgresse without cause.","4":"Shew me thy waies, O Lorde, and teache me thy paths.","5":"Leade me foorth in thy trueth, and teache me: for thou art the God of my saluation: in thee doe I trust all the day.","6":"Remember, O Lorde, thy tender mercies, and thy louing kindnesse: for they haue beene for euer.","7":"Remember not the sinnes of my youth, nor my rebellions, but according to thy kindenesse remember thou me, euen for thy goodnesse sake, O Lord.","8":"Gracious & righteous is the Lorde: therefore will he teache sinners in the way.","9":"Them that be meeke, will hee guide in iudgement, and teach the humble his way.","10":"All the pathes of the Lorde are mercie and trueth vnto such as keepe his couenant and his testimonies.","11":"For thy Names sake, O Lord, be merciful vnto mine iniquitie, for it is great.","12":"What man is he that feareth the Lorde? him wil he teache the way that hee shall chuse.","13":"His soule shall dwell at ease, and his seede shall inherite the land.","14":"The secrete of the Lorde is reueiled to them, that feare him: and his couenant to giue them vnderstanding.","15":"Mine eyes are euer towarde the Lorde: for he will bring my feete out of the net.","16":"Turne thy face vnto mee, and haue mercie vpon me: for I am desolate and poore.","17":"The sorowes of mine heart are enlarged: drawe me out of my troubles.","18":"Looke vpon mine affliction and my trauel, and forgiue all my sinnes.","19":"Beholde mine enemies, for they are manie, and they hate me with cruell hatred.","20":"Keepe my soule, and deliuer me: let me not be confounded, for I trust in thee.","21":"Let mine vprightnes and equitie preserue me: for mine hope is in thee.","22":"Deliuer Israel, O God, out of all his troubles."}
