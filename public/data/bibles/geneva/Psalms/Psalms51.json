{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid, when the Prophet Nathan came vnto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Haue mercie vpon me, O God, according to thy louing kindnes: according to the multitude of thy compassions put away mine iniquities.","2":"Wash me throughly from mine iniquitie, and clense me from my sinne.","3":"For I know mine iniquities, and my sinne is euer before me.","4":"Against thee, against thee onely haue I sinned, and done euill in thy sight, that thou mayest be iust when thou speakest, and pure when thou iudgest.","5":"Beholde, I was borne in iniquitie, and in sinne hath my mother conceiued me.","6":"Beholde, thou louest trueth in the inwarde affections: therefore hast thou taught mee wisedome in the secret of mine heart.","7":"Purge me with hyssope, & I shalbe cleane: wash me, and I shalbe whiter then snowe.","8":"Make me to heare ioye and gladnes, that the bones, which thou hast broken, may reioyce.","9":"Hide thy face from my sinnes, and put away all mine iniquities.","10":"Create in mee a cleane heart, O God, and renue a right spirit within me.","11":"Cast mee not away from thy presence, and take not thine holy Spirit from me.","12":"Restore to me the ioy of thy saluation, and stablish me with thy free Spirit.","13":"Then shall I teache thy wayes vnto the wicked, and sinners shalbe conuerted vnto thee.","14":"Deliuer me from blood, O God, which art the God of my saluation, and my tongue shall sing ioyfully of thy righteousnes.","15":"Open thou my lippes, O Lorde, and my mouth shall shewe foorth thy praise.","16":"For thou desirest no sacrifice, though I would giue it: thou delitest not in burnt offering.","17":"The sacrifices of God are a contrite spirit: a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.","18":"Bee fauourable vnto Zion for thy good pleasure: builde the walles of Ierusalem.","19":"Then shalt thou accept ye sacrifices of righteousnes, euen the burnt offering and oblation: then shall they offer calues vpon thine altar."}
