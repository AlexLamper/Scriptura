{"1":"To him that excelleth on Neginoth vpon the eight tune. A Psalme of Dauid. O lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy wrath.","2":"Haue mercie vpon me, O Lorde, for I am weake: O Lord heale me, for my bones are vexed.","3":"My soule is also sore troubled: but Lorde how long wilt thou delay?","4":"Returne, O Lord: deliuer my soule: saue me for thy mercies sake.","5":"For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the graue who shall prayse thee?","6":"I fainted in my mourning: I cause my bed euery night to swimme, and water my couch with my teares.","7":"Mine eye is dimmed for despight, and sunke in because of all mine enemies.","8":"Away from mee all ye workers of iniquitie: for the Lorde hath heard the voyce of my weeping.","9":"The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receiue my prayer.","10":"All mine enemies shall be confounded and sore vexed: they shall be turned backe, and put to shame suddenly."}
