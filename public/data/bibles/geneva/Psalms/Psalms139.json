{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. O Lord, thou hast tried me and knowen me.","2":"Thou knowest my sitting and my rising: thou vnderstandest my thought afarre off.","3":"Thou compassest my pathes, and my lying downe, and art accustomed to all my wayes.","4":"For there is not a word in my tongue, but loe, thou knowest it wholy, O Lord.","5":"Thou holdest mee straite behinde and before, and layest thine hand vpon me.","6":"Thy knowledge is too wonderfull for mee: it is so high that I cannot attaine vnto it.","7":"Whither shall I goe from thy Spirite? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?","8":"If I ascende into heauen, thou art there: if I lye downe in hell, thou art there.","9":"Let mee take the winges of the morning, and dwell in the vttermost parts of the sea:","10":"Yet thither shall thine hand leade me, and thy right hand holde me.","11":"If I say, Yet the darkenes shal hide me, euen the night shalbe light about me.","12":"Yea, the darkenes hideth not from thee: but the night shineth as the day: the darkenes and light are both alike.","13":"For thou hast possessed my reines: thou hast couered me in my mothers wombe.","14":"I will praise thee, for I am fearefully and wonderously made: marueilous are thy workes, and my soule knoweth it well.","15":"My bones are not hid from thee, though I was made in a secret place, and facioned beneath in the earth.","16":"Thine eyes did see me, when I was without forme: for in thy booke were all things written, which in continuance were facioned, when there was none of them before.","17":"Howe deare therefore are thy thoughtes vnto me, O God! how great is ye summe of them!","18":"If I should count them, they are moe then the sand: when I wake, I am still with thee.","19":"Oh that thou wouldest slay, O God, the wicked and bloody men, to whom I say, Depart ye from mee:","20":"Which speake wickedly of thee, and being thine enemies are lifted vp in vaine.","21":"Doe not I hate them, O Lorde, that hate thee? and doe not I earnestly contend with those that rise vp against thee?","22":"I hate them with an vnfained hatred, as they were mine vtter enemies.","23":"Try mee, O God, and knowe mine heart: prooue me and know my thoughtes,","24":"And consider if there be any way of wickednes in me, and leade me in the way for euer."}
