I Waited paciently for the Lorde, and he inclined vnto me, and heard my cry.","2":"Hee brought mee also out of the horrible pit, out of the myrie clay, and set my feete vpon the rocke, and ordered my goings.","3":"And he hath put in my mouth a new song of praise vnto our God: many shal see it and feare, and shall trust in the Lord.","4":"Blessed is the man that maketh the Lorde his trust, and regardeth not the proude, nor such as turne aside to lyes.","5":"O Lorde my God, thou hast made thy wonderfull workes so many, that none can count in order to thee thy thoughts toward vs: I would declare, and speake of them, but they are moe then I am able to expresse.","6":"Sacrifice & offering thou didest not desire: (for mine eares hast thou prepared) burnt offring and sinne offering hast thou not required.","7":"Then said I, Lo, I come: for in the rolle of the booke it is written of me,","8":"I desired to doe thy good will, O my God: yea, thy Lawe is within mine heart.","9":"I haue declared thy righteousnesse in the great Congregation: loe, I will not refraine my lippes: O Lord, thou knowest.","10":"I haue not hidde thy righteousnesse within mine heart, but I haue declared thy trueth and thy saluation: I haue not conceiled thy mercy and thy trueth from the great Congregation.","11":"Withdrawe not thou thy tender mercie from mee, O Lord: let thy mercie and thy trueth alway preserue me.","12":"For innumerable troubles haue compassed mee: my sinnes haue taken such holde vpon me, that I am not able to looke vp: yea, they are moe in nomber then the heares of mine head: therefore mine heart hath failed me.","13":"Let it please thee, O Lorde, to deliuer mee: make haste, O Lord, to helpe me.","14":"Let them be confounded & put to shame together, that seeke my soule to destroye it: let them be driuen backward and put to rebuke, that desire mine hurt.","15":"Let them be destroyed for a rewarde of their shame, which say vnto me, Aha, aha.","16":"Let all them, that seeke thee, reioyce and be glad in thee: and let them, that loue thy saluation, say alway, The Lord be praysed.","17":"Though I be poore and needie, the Lorde thinketh on mee: thou art mine helper and my deliuerer: my God, make no tarying."}
