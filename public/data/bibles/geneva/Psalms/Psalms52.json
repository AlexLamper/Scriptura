{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid to giue instruction. When Doeg the Edomite came and shewed Saul, and saide to him, Dauid is come to the house of Abimelech. Why boastest thou thy selfe in thy wickednesse, O man of power? the louing kindenesse of God indureth dayly.","2":"Thy tongue imagineth mischiefe, and is like a sharpe rasor, that cutteth deceitfully.","3":"Thou doest loue euill more then good, and lies more then to speake the trueth. Selah.","4":"Thou louest all wordes that may destroye, O deceitfull tongue!","5":"So shal God destroy thee for euer: he shal take thee and plucke thee out of thy tabernacle, and roote thee out of ye land of the liuing. Selah.","6":"The righteous also shall see it, and feare, and shall laugh at him, saying,","7":"Beholde the man that tooke not God for his strength, but trusted vnto the multitude of his riches, and put his strength in his malice.","8":"But I shall bee like a greene oliue tree in the house of God: for I trusted in the mercie of God for euer and euer.","9":"I will alway praise thee, for that thou hast done this, and I will hope in thy Name, because it is good before thy Saints."}
