{"1":"Why doe the heathen rage, & the people murmure in vaine?","2":"The Kings of the earth band themselues, and the princes are assembled together against the Lord, and against his Christ.","3":"Let vs breake their bands, and cast their cordes from vs.","4":"But he that dwelleth in the heauen, shall laugh: the Lord shall haue them in derision.","5":"Then shall hee speake vnto them in his wrath, & vexe them in his sore displeasure, saying,","6":"Euen I haue set my King vpon Zion mine holy mountaine.","7":"I will declare the decree: that is, the Lord hath said vnto me, Thou art my Sonne: this day haue I begotten thee.","8":"Aske of me, and I shall giue thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the endes of the earth for thy possession.","9":"Thou shalt krush them with a scepter of yron, and breake them in pieces like a potters vessell.","10":"Be wise nowe therefore, ye Kings: be learned ye Iudges of the earth.","11":"Serue the Lorde in feare, and reioyce in trembling.","12":"Kisse the sonne, least he be angry, and ye perish in the way, when his wrath shall suddenly burne. blessed are all that trust in him."}
