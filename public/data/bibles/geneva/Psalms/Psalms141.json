{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. O Lord, I call vpon thee: haste thee vnto me: heare my voyce, when I cry vnto thee.","2":"Let my prayer be directed in thy sight as incense, and the lifting vp of mine hands as an euening sacrifice.","3":"Set a watch, O Lorde, before my mouth, and keepe the doore of my lips.","4":"Incline not mine heart to euill, that I should commit wicked workes with men that worke iniquitie: and let me not eate of their delicates.","5":"Let the righteous smite me: for that is a benefite: and let him reprooue me, and it shalbe a precious oyle, that shall not breake mine head: for within a while I shall euen pray in their miseries.","6":"When their iudges shall be cast downe in stonie places, they shal heare my wordes, for they are sweete.","7":"Our bones lye scattered at the graues mouth, as he that heweth wood or diggeth in the earth.","8":"But mine eyes looke vnto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust: leaue not my soule destitute.","9":"Keepe me from the snare, which they haue layde for me, and from the grennes of the workers of iniquitie.","10":"Let the wicked fall into his nettes together, whiles I escape."}
