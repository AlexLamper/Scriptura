{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. In thee, O Lorde, haue I put my trust: let mee neuer be confounded: deliuer me in thy righteousnesse.","2":"Bowe downe thine eare to me: make haste to deliuer mee: be vnto me a stronge rocke, and an house of defence to saue me.","3":"For thou art my rocke and my fortresse: therefore for thy Names sake directe mee and guide me.","4":"Drawe mee out of the nette, that they haue layde priuilie for mee: for thou art my strength.","5":"Into thine hand I commend my spirit: for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of trueth.","6":"I haue hated them that giue them selues to deceitfull vanities: for I trust in the Lord.","7":"I wil be glad and reioyce in thy mercie: for thou hast seene my trouble: thou hast knowen my soule in aduersities,","8":"And thou hast not shut me vp in the hand of the enemie, but hast set my feete at large.","9":"Haue mercie vpon mee, O Lorde: for I am in trouble: mine eye, my soule and my bellie are consumed with griefe.","10":"For my life is wasted with heauinesse, and my yeeres with mourning: my strength faileth for my paine, and my bones are consumed.","11":"I was a reproch among all mine enemies, but specially among my neighbours: and a feare to mine acquaintance, who seeing me in the streete, fled from me.","12":"I am forgotten, as a dead man out of minde: I am like a broken vessell.","13":"For I haue heard the rayling of great men: feare was on euery side, while they conspired together against mee, and consulted to take my life.","14":"But I trusted in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God.","15":"My times are in thine hande: deliuer mee from the hande of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.","16":"Make thy face to shine vpon thy seruant, and saue me through thy mercie.","17":"Let me not be confounded, O Lorde: for I haue called vpon thee: let the wicked bee put to confusion, and to silence in the graue.","18":"Let the lying lips be made dumme, which cruelly, proudly and spitefully speake against the righteous.","19":"Howe great is thy goodnesse, which thou hast layde vp for them, that feare thee! and done to them, that trust in thee, euen before the sonnes of men!","20":"Thou doest hide them priuily in thy presence from the pride of men: thou keepest them secretly in thy Tabernacle from the strife of tongues.","21":"Blessed be the Lorde: for hee hath shewed his marueilous kindenesse toward me in a strong citie.","22":"Though I said in mine haste, I am cast out of thy sight, yet thou heardest the voyce of my prayer, when I cryed vnto thee.","23":"Loue ye the Lorde all his Saintes: for the Lord preserueth the faithfull, and rewardeth abundantly the proud doer.","24":"All ye that trust in the Lorde, be strong, and he shall establish your heart."}
