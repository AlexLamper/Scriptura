{"1":"A song of degres, or Psalme of Dauid. When ye Lord brought againe the captiuitie of Zion, we were like them that dreame.","2":"Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ioye: then sayd they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.","3":"The Lord hath done great things for vs, whereof we reioyce.","4":"O Lord, bring againe our captiuitie, as the riuers in the South.","5":"They that sowe in teares, shall reape in ioy.","6":"They went weeping and caried precious seede: but they shall returne with ioye and bring their sheaues."}
