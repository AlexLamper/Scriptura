{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The foole hath said in his heart, There is no God: they haue corrupted, & done an abominable worke: there is none that doeth good.","2":"The Lord looked downe from heauen vpon the children of men, to see if there were any that would vnderstand, and seeke God.","3":"All are gone out of the way: they are all corrupt: there is none that doeth good, no not one.","4":"Doe not all the workers of iniquitie know that they eate vp my people, as they eate bread? They call not vpon the Lord.","5":"There they shall be taken with feare, because God is in the generation of the iust.","6":"You haue made a mocke at the counsell of the poore, because the Lord is his trust.","7":"Oh giue saluation vnto Israel out of Zion: when the Lorde turneth the captiuitie of his people, then Iaakob shall reioyce, and Israel shall be glad."}
