{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. Heare my voyce, O God, in my prayer: preserue my life from feare of the enemie.","2":"Hide me from the conspiracie of the wicked, and from the rage of the workers of iniquitie.","3":"Which haue whette their tongue like a sword, and shot for their arrowes bitter wordes.","4":"To shoote at the vpright in secrete: they shoote at him suddenly, and feare not.","5":"They encourage themselues in a wicked purpose: they commune together to lay snares priuilie, and say, Who shall see them?","6":"They haue sought out iniquities, and haue accomplished that which they sought out, euen euery one his secret thoughtes, and the depth of his heart.","7":"But God will shoote an arrowe at them suddenly: their strokes shalbe at once.","8":"They shall cause their owne tongue to fall vpon them: and whosoeuer shall see them, shall flee away.","9":"And all men shall see it, and declare the worke of God, and they shall vnderstand, what he hath wrought.","10":"But the righteous shalbe glad in the Lord, and trust in him: and all that are vpright of heart, shall reioyce."}
