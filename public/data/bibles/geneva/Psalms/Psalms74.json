{"1":"A Psalme to giue instruction, committed to Asaph. O God, why hast thou put vs away for euer? why is thy wrath kindled against the sheepe of thy pasture?","2":"Thinke vpon thy Congregation, which thou hast possessed of olde, and on the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed, and on this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.","3":"Lift vp thy strokes, that thou mayest for euer destroy euery enemie that doeth euill to the Sanctuarie.","4":"Thine aduersaries roare in the middes of thy Congregation, and set vp their banners for signes.","5":"He that lifted the axes vpon the thicke trees, was renowmed, as one, that brought a thing to perfection:","6":"But nowe they breake downe the carued worke thereof with axes and hammers.","7":"They haue cast thy Sanctuarie into the fire, and rased it to the grounde, and haue defiled the dwelling place of thy Name.","8":"They saide in their hearts, Let vs destroy them altogether: they haue burnt all the Synagogues of God in the land.","9":"We see not our signes: there is not one Prophet more, nor any with vs that knoweth howe long.","10":"O God, howe long shall the aduersarie reproche thee? shall the enemie blaspheme thy Name for euer?","11":"Why withdrawest thou thine hand, euen thy right hand? drawe it out of thy bosome, and consume them.","12":"Euen God is my King of olde, working saluation in the middes of the earth.","13":"Thou didest deuide the sea by thy power: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.","14":"Thou brakest the head of Liuiathan in pieces, and gauest him to be meate for the people in wildernesse.","15":"Thou brakest vp the fountaine and riuer: thou dryedst vp mightie riuers.","16":"The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sunne.","17":"Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.","18":"Remember this, that the enemie hath reproched the Lorde, and the foolish people hath blasphemed thy Name.","19":"Giue not the soule of thy turtle doue vnto the beast, and forget not the Congregation of thy poore for euer.","20":"Consider thy couenant: for the darke places of the earth are full of the habitations of the cruell.","21":"Oh let not the oppressed returne ashamed, but let the poore and needie prayse thy Name.","22":"Arise, O God: mainteine thine owne cause: remember thy dayly reproche by the foolish man.","23":"Forget not the voyce of thine enemies: for the tumult of them, that rise against thee, ascendeth continually."}
