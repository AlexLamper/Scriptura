{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid, to giue instruction, and a prayer, when he was in the caue. I cryed vnto the Lord with my voyce: with my voyce I prayed vnto the Lord.","2":"I powred out my meditation before him, and declared mine affliction in his presence.","3":"Though my spirit was in perplexitie in me, yet thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I walked, haue they priuily layde a snare for me.","4":"I looked vpon my right hand, and beheld, but there was none that would knowe me: all refuge failed me, and none cared for my soule.","5":"Then cryed I vnto thee, O Lord, and sayde, thou art mine hope, and my portion in the land of the liuing.","6":"Hearken vnto my crye, for I am brought very lowe: deliuer me from my persecuters, for they are too strong for me.","7":"Bring my soule out of prison, that I may prayse thy Name: then shal the righteous come about me, when thou art beneficiall vnto me."}
