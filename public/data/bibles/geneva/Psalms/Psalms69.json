{"1":"To him that excelleth vpon Shoshannim. A Psalme of Dauid. Saue mee, O God: for the waters are entred euen to my soule.","2":"I sticke fast in the deepe myre, where no staie is: I am come into deepe waters, and the streames runne ouer me.","3":"I am wearie of crying: my throte is drie: mine eyes faile, whiles I waite for my God.","4":"They that hate mee without a cause, are moe then the heares of mine heade: they that would destroy mee, and are mine enemies falsly, are mightie, so that I restored that which I tooke not.","5":"O God, thou knowest my foolishnesse, and my fautes are not hid from thee.","6":"Let not them that trust in thee, O Lorde God of hostes, be ashamed for me: let not those that seeke thee, be confounded through mee, O God of Israel.","7":"For thy sake haue I suffred reproofe: shame hath couered my face.","8":"I am become a stranger vnto my brethren, euen an aliant vnto my mothers sonnes.","9":"For the zeale of thine house hath eaten mee, and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee, are fallen vpon me.","10":"I wept and my soule fasted, but that was to my reproofe.","11":"I put on a sacke also: and I became a prouerbe vnto them.","12":"They that sate in the gate, spake of mee, and the drunkardes sang of me.","13":"But Lorde, I make my praier vnto thee in an acceptable time, euen in the multitude of thy mercie: O God, heare me in the trueth of thy saluation.","14":"Deliuer mee out of the myre, that I sinke not: let me be deliuered from them that hate me, and out of the deepe waters.","15":"Let not the water flood drowne mee, neither let the deepe swallowe me vp: and let not the pit shut her mouth vpon me.","16":"Heare me, O Lord, for thy louing kindnes is good: turne vnto me according to ye multitude of thy tender mercies.","17":"And hide not thy face from thy seruant, for I am in trouble: make haste and heare me.","18":"Draw neere vnto my soule and redeeme it: deliuer me because of mine enemies.","19":"Thou hast knowen my reproofe and my shame, and my dishonour: all mine aduersaries are before thee.","20":"Rebuke hath broken mine heart, and I am full of heauinesse, and I looked for some to haue pitie on me, but there was none: and for comforters, but I found none.","21":"For they gaue me gall in my meate, and in my thirst they gaue me vineger to drinke.","22":"Let their table be a snare before them, and their prosperitie their ruine.","23":"Let their eyes be blinded that they see not: and make their loynes alway to tremble.","24":"Powre out thine anger vpon them, and let thy wrathfull displeasure take them.","25":"Let their habitation be voide, and let none dwell in their tents.","26":"For they persecute him, whome thou hast smitten: and they adde vnto the sorrowe of them, whome thou hast wounded.","27":"Laie iniquitie vpon their iniquitie, and let them not come into thy righteousnesse.","28":"Let them be put out of the booke of life, neither let them be written with the righteous.","29":"When I am poore and in heauinesse, thine helpe, O God, shall exalt me.","30":"I will praise the Name of God with a song, and magnifie him with thankesgiuing.","31":"This also shall please the Lord better then a yong bullocke, that hath hornes and hoofes.","32":"The humble shall see this, and they that seeke God, shalbe glad, and your heart shall liue.","33":"For the Lord heareth the poore, and despiseth not his prisoners.","34":"Let heauen and earth praise him: the seas and all that moueth in them.","35":"For God will saue Zion, and builde the cities of Iudah, that men may dwell there and haue it in possession.","36":"The seede also of his seruants shal inherit it: and they that loue his name, shall dwel therein."}
