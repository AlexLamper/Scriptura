{"1":"Blessed is the man that doeth not walke in the counsell of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in ye seate of the scornefull:","2":"But his delite is in the Lawe of the Lord, and in his Lawe doeth he meditate day and night.","3":"For he shall be like a tree planted by the riuers of waters, that will bring foorth her fruite in due season: whose leafe shall not fade: so whatsoeuer he shall doe, shall prosper.","4":"The wicked are not so, but as the chaffe, which the winde driueth away.","5":"Therefore the wicked shall not stande in the iudgement, nor sinners in the assemblie of the righteous.","6":"For the Lorde knoweth the way of the righteous, & the way of the wicked shal perish."}
