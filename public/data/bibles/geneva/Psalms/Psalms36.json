{"1":"To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid, the seruant of the Lord. Wickednes sayeth to the wicked man, euen in mine heart, that there is no feare of God before his eyes.","2":"For hee flattereth himselfe in his owne eyes, while his iniquitie is foud worthy to be hated.","3":"The wordes of his mouth are iniquitie and deceit: hee hath left off to vnderstand and to doe good.","4":"Hee imagineth mischiefe vpon his bed: he setteth himselfe vpon a way, that is not good, and doeth not abhorre euill.","5":"Thy mercy, O Lord, reacheth vnto the heauens, and thy faithfulnesse vnto the cloudes.","6":"Thy righteousnesse is like the mightie moutaines: thy iudgements are like a great deepe: thou, Lord, doest saue man and beast.","7":"How excellent is thy mercy, O God! therefore the children of men trust vnder the shadowe of thy wings.","8":"They shall be satisfied with the fatnesse of thine house, and thou shalt giue them drinke out of the riuer of thy pleasures.","9":"For with thee is the well of life, and in thy light shall we see light.","10":"Extend thy louing kindnes vnto them that knowe thee, and thy righteousnesse vnto them that are vpright in heart.","11":"Let not ye foote of pride come against me, and let not the hand of ye wicked men moue me.","12":"There they are fallen that worke iniquity: they are cast downe, and shal not be able to rise."}
