{"1":"A song of degrees. Lord, remember Dauid with all his affliction.","2":"Who sware vnto the Lorde, and vowed vnto the mightie God of Iaakob, saying,","3":"I will not enter into the tabernacle of mine house, nor come vpon my pallet or bed,","4":"Nor suffer mine eyes to sleepe, nor mine eye lids to slumber,","5":"Vntill I finde out a place for the Lorde, an habitation for the mightie God of Iaakob.","6":"Lo, we heard of it in Ephrathah, and found it in the fieldes of the forest.","7":"We will enter into his Tabernacles, and worship before his footestoole.","8":"Arise, O Lord, to come into thy rest, thou, and the Arke of thy strength.","9":"Let thy Priests be clothed with righteousnesse, and let thy Saints reioyce.","10":"For thy seruant Dauids sake refuse not the face of thine Anointed.","11":"The Lord hath sworne in trueth vnto Dauid, and he wil not shrinke from it, saying, Of the fruite of thy body will I set vpon thy throne.","12":"If thy sonnes keepe my couenant, and my testimonies, that I shall teach them, their sonnes also shall sit vpon thy throne for euer.","13":"For the Lord hath chosen Zion, and loued to dwell in it, saying,","14":"This is my rest for euer: here will I dwell, for I haue a delite therein.","15":"I will surely blesse her vitailes, and will satisfie her poore with bread,","16":"And will clothe her Priests with saluation, and her Saints shall shoute for ioye.","17":"There will I make the horne of Dauid to bud: for I haue ordeined a light for mine Anoynted.","18":"His enemies will I clothe with shame, but on him his crowne shall florish."}
