{"1":"A Psalme of Dauid. The earth is the Lordes, and all that therein is: the worlde and they that dwell therein.","2":"For he hath founded it vpon the seas: and established it vpon the floods.","3":"Who shall ascende into the mountaine of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place?","4":"Euen he that hath innocent handes, and a pure heart: which hath not lift vp his minde vnto vanitie, nor sworne deceitfully.","5":"He shall receiue a blessing from the Lorde, and righteousnesse from the God of his saluation.","6":"This is the generation of them that seeke him, of them that seeke thy face, this is Iaakob. Selah.","7":"Lift vp your heads ye gates, and be ye lift vp ye euerlasting doores, and the King of glory shall come in.","8":"Who is this King of glorie? the Lord, strong and mightie, euen the Lord mightie in battell.","9":"Lift vp your heads, ye gates, and lift vp your selues, ye euerlasting doores, and the King of glorie shall come in.","10":"Who is this King of glory? the Lorde of hostes, he is the King of glorie. Selah."}
