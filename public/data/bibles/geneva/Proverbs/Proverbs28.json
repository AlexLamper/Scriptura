{"1":"The wicked flee when none pursueth: but the righteous are bolde as a lyon.","2":"For the transgression of the land there are many princes thereof: but by a man of vnderstanding and knowledge a realme likewise endureth long.","3":"A poore man, if he oppresse the poore, is like a raging raine, that leaueth no foode.","4":"They that forsake the Law, prayse the wicked: but they that keepe the Law, set themselues against them.","5":"Wicked men vnderstand not iudgemnt: but they that seeke the Lord vnderstand all things.","6":"Better is the poore that walketh in his vprightnesse, then hee that peruerteth his wayes, though he be riche.","7":"He that keepeth the Law, is a childe of vnderstanding: but hee that feedeth the gluttons, shameth his father.","8":"He that increaseth his riches by vsurie and interest, gathereth them for him that will be mercifull vnto the poore.","9":"He that turneth away his eare fro hearing the Law, euen his prayer shalbe abominable.","10":"He that causeth the righteous to go astray by an euill way, shal fall into his owne pit, and the vpright shall inherite good things.","11":"The riche man is wise in his owne conceite: but the poore that hath vnderstanding, can trie him.","12":"When righteous men reioyce, there is great glory: but when the wicked come vp, the man is tried.","13":"He that hideth his sinnes, shall not prosper: but he that confesseth, and forsaketh them, shall haue mercy.","14":"Blessed is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart, shal fall into euill.","15":"As a roaring lyon, and an hungry beare, so is a wicked ruler ouer the poore people.","16":"A prince destitute of vnderstanding, is also a great oppressour: but hee that hateth couetousnes, shall prolong his dayes.","17":"A man that doeth violence against the blood of a person, shall flee vnto the graue, and they shall not stay him.","18":"He that walketh vprightly, shalbe saued: but he that is froward in his wayes, shall once fall.","19":"He that tilleth his land, shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth the idle, shall be filled with pouertie.","20":"A faythfull man shall abound in blessings, and he that maketh haste to be riche, shall not be innocent.","21":"To haue respect of persons is not good: for that man will transgresse for a piece of bread.","22":"A man with a wicked eye hasteth to riches, and knoweth not, that pouertie shall come vpon him.","23":"He that rebuketh a man, shall finde more fauour at length, then he that flattereth with his tongue.","24":"Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and sayth, It is no transgression, is the companion of a man that destroyeth.","25":"He that is of a proude heart, stirreth vp strife: but he that trusteth in the Lorde, shall be fatte.","26":"Hee that trusteth in his owne heart, is a foole: but he that walketh in wisdome, shall be deliuered.","27":"He that giueth vnto the poore, shall not lacke: but he that hideth his eyes, shall haue many curses.","28":"When the wicked rise vp, men hide them selues: but when they perish, ye righteous increase."}
