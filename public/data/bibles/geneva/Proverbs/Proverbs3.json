{"1":"My sonne, forget not thou my Lawe, but let thine heart keepe my commandements.","2":"For they shall increase the length of thy dayes and the yeeres of life, and thy prosperitie.","3":"Let not mercie and trueth forsake thee: binde them on thy necke, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.","4":"So shalt thou finde fauour and good vnderstanding in the sight of God and man.","5":"Trust in the Lorde with all thine heart, and leane not vnto thine owne wisdome.","6":"In all thy wayes acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy wayes.","7":"Be not wise in thine owne eyes: but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.","8":"So health shalbe vnto thy nauel, and marowe vnto thy bones.","9":"Honour the Lorde with thy riches, and with the first fruites of all thine increase.","10":"So shall thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall burst with newe wine.","11":"My sonne, refuse not the chastening of the Lord, neither be grieued with his correction.","12":"For the Lord correcteth him, whome he loueth, euen as the father doeth the childe in whom he deliteth.","13":"Blessed is the man that findeth wisedome, and the man that getteth vnderstanding.","14":"For the marchandise thereof is better then the marchandise of siluer, and the gaine thereof is better then golde.","15":"It is more precious then pearles: and all things that thou canst desire, are not to be compared vnto her.","16":"Length of dayes is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and glory.","17":"Her wayes are wayes of pleasure, and all her pathes prosperitie.","18":"She is a tree of life to them that lay holde on her, and blessed is he that retaineth her.","19":"The Lorde by wisdome hath layde the foundation of the earth, and hath stablished the heauens through vnderstanding.","20":"By his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the cloudes droppe downe the dewe.","21":"My sonne, let not these things depart from thine eyes, but obserue wisdome, and counsell.","22":"So they shalbe life to thy soule, and grace vnto thy necke.","23":"Then shalt thou walke safely by thy way: and thy foote shall not stumble.","24":"If thou sleepest, thou shalt not bee afraide, and when thou sleepest, thy sleepe shalbe sweete.","25":"Thou shalt not feare for any sudden feare, neither for the destruction of the wicked, when it commeth.","26":"For the Lorde shall be for thine assurance, and shall preserue thy foote from taking.","27":"Withhold not the good from the owners thereof, though there be power in thine hand to doe it.","28":"Say not vnto thy neighbour, Go and come againe, and to morow wil I giue thee, if thou now haue it.","29":"Intend none hurt against thy neighbour, seeing he doeth dwell without feare by thee.","30":"Striue not with a man causelesse, when he hath done thee no harme.","31":"Bee not enuious for the wicked man, neither chuse any of his wayes.","32":"For the frowarde is abomination vnto the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous.","33":"The curse of the Lorde is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.","34":"With the scornefull he scorneth, but hee giueth grace vnto the humble.","35":"The wise shall inherite glorie: but fooles dishonour, though they be exalted."}
