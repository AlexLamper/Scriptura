{"1":"The Parables of Salomon the sonne of Dauid King of Israel,","2":"To knowe wisdome, and instruction, to vnderstand ye wordes of knowledge,","3":"To receiue instruction to do wisely, by iustice and iudgement and equitie,","4":"To giue vnto the simple, sharpenesse of wit, and to the childe knowledge and discretion.","5":"A wise man shall heare and increase in learning, and a man of vnderstanding shall attayne vnto wise counsels,","6":"To vnderstand a parable, & the interpretation, the wordes of ye wise, and their darke sayings.","7":"The feare of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles despise wisedome and instruction.","8":"My sonne, heare thy fathers instruction, and forsake not thy mothers teaching.","9":"For they shalbe a comely ornament vnto thine head, and as chaines for thy necke.","10":"My sonne, if sinners doe intise thee, consent thou not.","11":"If they say, Come with vs, we will lay waite for blood, and lie priuilie for the innocent without a cause:","12":"We wil swallow them vp aliue like a graue euen whole, as those that goe downe into the pit:","13":"We shall finde all precious riches, and fill our houses with spoyle:","14":"Cast in thy lot among vs: we will all haue one purse:","15":"My sonne, walke not thou in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.","16":"For their feete runne to euill, & make haste to shed blood.","17":"Certainely as without cause the net is spred before the eyes of all that hath wing:","18":"So they lay waite for blood and lie priuily for their liues.","19":"Such are the wayes of euery one that is greedy of gaine: he would take away the life of the owners thereof.","20":"Wisdome cryeth without: she vttereth her voyce in the streetes.","21":"She calleth in the hye streete, among the prease in the entrings of the gates, and vttereth her wordes in the citie, saying,","22":"O ye foolish, howe long will ye loue foolishnes? and the scornefull take their pleasure in scorning, and the fooles hate knowledge?","23":"(Turne you at my correction: loe, I will powre out my mind vnto you, and make you vnderstand my wordes)","24":"Because I haue called, & ye refused: I haue stretched out mine hand, & none woulde regarde.","25":"But ye haue despised all my counsell, and would none of my correction.","26":"I will also laugh at your destruction, and mocke, when your feare commeth.","27":"Whe your feare cometh like sudden desolation, & your destruction shall come like a whirle wind: whe affliction & anguish shal come vpo you,","28":"Then shall they call vpon me, but I will not answere: they shall seeke me early, but they shall not finde me,","29":"Because they hated knowledge, and did not chuse the feare of the Lord.","30":"They would none of my counsell, but despised all my correction.","31":"Therefore shal they eate of ye fruite of their owne way, and be filled with their owne deuises.","32":"For ease slaieth the foolish, and the prosperitie of fooles destroyeth them.","33":"But he that obeyeth me, shall dwell safely, and be quiet from feare of euill."}
