{"1":"These are also Parables of Salomon, which the men of Hezekiah King of Iudah copied out.","2":"The glorie of God is to conceale a thing secret: but the Kings honour is to search out a thing.","3":"The heaues in height, & the earth in deepenes, and the Kings heart can no man search out.","4":"Take the drosse from the siluer, and there shall proceede a vessell for the finer.","5":"Take away the wicked from the King, and his throne shall be stablished in righteousnes.","6":"Boast not thy selfe before the King, and stand not in the place of great men.","7":"For it is better, that it be saide vnto thee, Come vp hither, then thou to be put lower in the presece of the prince whom thine eyes haue seene.","8":"Goe not foorth hastily to strife, least thou know not what to doe in the ende thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.","9":"Debate thy matter with thy neighbour, and discouer not the secret to another,","10":"Least he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamie doe not cease.","11":"A word spoken in his place, is like apples of golde with pictures of siluer.","12":"He that reprooueth the wise, and the obedient eare, is as a golden earering and an ornament of fine golde.","13":"As the colde of the snowe in the time of haruest, so is a faithfull messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soule of his masters.","14":"A man that boasteth of false liberalitie, is like cloudes and winde without raine.","15":"A Prince is pacified by staying of anger, and a soft tongue breaketh the bones.","16":"If thou haue found hony, eate that is sufficient for thee, least thou be ouerfull, & vomit it.","17":"Withdrawe thy foote from thy neighbours house, least he be weary of thee, and hate thee.","18":"A man that beareth false witnes against his neighbour, is like an hammer and a sword, and a sharpe arrowe.","19":"Confidence in an vnfaythfull man in time of trouble, is like a broken tooth and a sliding foote.","20":"Hee that taketh away the garment in the colde season, is like vineger powred vpon nitre, or like him that singeth songs to an heauy heart.","21":"If hee that hateth thee be hungry, giue him bread to eate, and if he be thirstie, giue him water to drinke.","22":"For thou shalt lay coles vpon his head, and the Lord shall recompense thee.","23":"As the Northwinde driueth away the raine, so doeth an angry countenance the slandering tongue.","24":"It is better to dwell in a corner of the house top, then with a contentious woman in a wide house.","25":"As are the colde waters to a weary soule, so is good newes from a farre countery.","26":"A righteous man falling downe before the wicked, is like a troubled well, & a corrupt spring.","27":"It is not good to eate much hony: so to search their owne glory is not glory.","28":"A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a citie which is broken downe and without walles."}
