{"1":"When thou sittest to eate with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee,","2":"And put the knife to thy throte, if thou be a man giuen to the appetite.","3":"Be not desirous of his deintie meates: for it is a deceiuable meate.","4":"Trauaile not too much to be rich: but cease from thy wisdome.","5":"Wilt thou cast thine eyes vpon it, which is nothing? For riches taketh her to her wings, as an eagle, and flyeth into the heauen.","6":"Eate thou not the bread of him that hath an euil eye, neither desire his deintie meates.","7":"For as though he thought it in his heart, so will hee say vnto thee, Eate and drinke: but his heart is not with thee.","8":"Thou shalt vomit thy morsels that thou hast eaten, and thou shalt lose thy sweete wordes.","9":"Speake not in the eares of a foole: for hee will despise the wisdome of thy wordes.","10":"Remooue not the ancient boundes, and enter not into the fieldes of the fatherlesse.","11":"For he that redeemeth them, is mightie: he will defend their cause against thee.","12":"Apply thine heart to instruction, and thine eares to the wordes of knowledge.","13":"Withhold not correction from the childe: if thou smite him with the rodde, he shall not die.","14":"Thou shalt smite him with the rodde, and shalt deliuer his soule from hell.","15":"My sonne, if thine heart be wise, mine heart shall reioyce, and I also.","16":"And my reynes shall reioyce, when thy lips speake righteous things.","17":"Let not thine heart bee enuious against sinners: but let it bee in the feare of the Lorde continually.","18":"For surely there is an ende, and thy hope shall not be cut off.","19":"O thou my sonne, heare, and bee wise, and guide thine heart in the way.","20":"Keepe not company with drunkards, nor with gluttons.","21":"For the drunkard and the glutton shall bee poore, and the sleeper shalbe clothed with ragges.","22":"Obey thy father that hath begotten thee, and despise not thy mother when she is olde.","23":"Bye the trueth, but sell it not: likewise wisdome, and instruction, and vnderstanding.","24":"The father of the righteous shal greatly reioyce, and hee that begetteth a wise childe, shall haue ioy of him.","25":"Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall reioyce.","26":"My sonne, giue mee thine heart, and let thine eyes delite in my wayes.","27":"For a whore is as a deepe ditche, and a strange woman is as a narrowe pitte.","28":"Also she lyeth in wait as for a praye, and she increaseth the transgressers among men.","29":"To whome is woe? to whome is sorowe? to whom is strife? to whom is murmuring? to whom are woundes without cause? and to whome is the rednesse of the eyes?","30":"Euen to them that tarie long at the wine, to them that goe, and seeke mixt wine.","31":"Looke not thou vpon the wine, when it is red, and when it sheweth his colour in the cup, or goeth downe pleasantly.","32":"In the ende thereof it will bite like a serpent, and hurt like a cockatrise.","33":"Thine eyes shall looke vpon strange women, and thine heart shall speake lewde things.","34":"And thou shalt bee as one that sleepeth in the middes of the sea, and as hee that sleepeth in the toppe of the maste.","35":"They haue stricken mee, shalt thou say, but I was not sicke: they haue beaten mee, but I knew not, when I awoke: therefore will I seeke it yet still."}
