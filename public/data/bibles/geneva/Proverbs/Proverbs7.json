{"1":"My sonne, keepe my wordes, & hide my commandements with thee.","2":"Keepe my commandements, and thou shalt liue, and mine instruction as the apple of thine eyes.","3":"Binde them vpon thy fingers, and write them vpon the table of thine heart.","4":"Say vnto wisedome, Thou art my sister: and call vnderstanding thy kinswoman,","5":"That they may keepe thee from the strange woman, euen from the stranger that is smoothe in her wordes.","6":"As I was in the window of mine house, I looked through my windowe,","7":"And I sawe among the fooles, and considered among the children a yong man destitute of vnderstanding,","8":"Who passed through the streete by her corner, and went toward her house,","9":"In the twilight in the euening, when the night began to be blacke and darke.","10":"And beholde, there met him a woman with an harlots behauiour, and subtill in heart.","11":"(She is babling and loud: whose feete can not abide in her house.","12":"Nowe she is without, nowe in the streetes, and lyeth in waite at euery corner)","13":"So she caught him & kissed him and with an impudent face said vnto him,","14":"I haue peace offerings: this day haue I payed my vowes.","15":"Therefore came I forth to meete thee, that I might seeke thy face: and I haue found thee.","16":"I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt.","17":"I haue perfumed my bedde with myrrhe, aloes, and cynamom.","18":"Come, let vs take our fill of loue vntill the morning: let vs take our pleasure in daliance.","19":"For mine husbande is not at home: he is gone a iourney farre off.","20":"He hath taken with him a bagge of siluer, and will come home at the day appointed.","21":"Thus with her great craft she caused him to yeelde, and with her flattering lips she entised him.","22":"And he followed her straight wayes, as an oxe that goeth to the slaughter, and as a foole to the stockes for correction,","23":"Till a dart strike through his liuer, as a bird hasteth to the snare, not knowing that he is in danger.","24":"Heare me now therefore, O children, and hearken to the wordes of my mouth.","25":"Let not thine heart decline to her wayes: wander thou not in her paths.","26":"For shee hath caused many to fall downe wounded, & the strong men are all slaine by her.","27":"Her house is the way vnto ye graue, which goeth downe to the chambers of death."}
