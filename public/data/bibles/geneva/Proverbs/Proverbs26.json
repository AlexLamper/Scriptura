{"1":"As the snowe in the sommer, and as the raine in the haruest are not meete, so is honour vnseemely for a foole.","2":"As the sparowe by flying, and the swallow by flying escape, so the curse that is causeles, shall not come.","3":"Vnto the horse belongeth a whip, to the asse a bridle, and a rod to the fooles backe.","4":"Answer not a foole according to his foolishnes, least thou also be like him.","5":"Answere a foole according to his foolishnes, least he be wise in his owne conceite.","6":"He that sendeth a message by the hand of a foole, is as he that cutteth off the feete, and drinketh iniquitie.","7":"As they that lift vp the legs of the lame, so is a parable in a fooles mouth.","8":"As the closing vp of a precious stone in an heape of stones, so is he that giueth glory to a foole.","9":"As a thorne standing vp in the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fooles.","10":"The excellent that formed all things, both rewardeth the foole & rewardeth the transgressers.","11":"As a dog turneth againe to his owne vomit, so a foole turneth to his foolishnes.","12":"Seest thou a man wise in his owne conceite? more hope is of a foole then of him.","13":"The slouthfull man sayth, A lyon is in the way: a lyon is in the streetes.","14":"As the doore turneth vpon his hinges, so doeth the slouthfull man vpon his bed.","15":"The slouthfull hideth his hand in his bosome, and it grieueth him to put it againe to his mouth.","16":"The sluggard is wiser in his owne conceite, then seuen men that can render a reason.","17":"He that passeth by and medleth with the strife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dog by the eares.","18":"As he that faineth himselfe mad, casteth fire brands, arrowes, and mortall things,","19":"So dealeth the deceitfull man with his friend and sayth, Am not I in sport?","20":"Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer strife ceaseth.","21":"As ye cole maketh burning coles, & wood a fire, so the contentious man is apt to kindle strife.","22":"The wordes of a tale bearer are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly.","23":"As siluer drosse ouerlayde vpon a potsheard, so are burning lips, and an euill heart.","24":"He that hateth, will counterfaite with his lips, but in his heart he layeth vp deceite.","25":"Though he speake fauourably, beleeue him not: for there are seuen abominations in his heart.","26":"Hatred may be couered by deceite: but the malice thereof shall be discouered in the congregation.","27":"He that diggeth a pit shal fall therein, and he that rolleth a stone, it shall returne vnto him.","28":"A false tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth causeth ruine."}
