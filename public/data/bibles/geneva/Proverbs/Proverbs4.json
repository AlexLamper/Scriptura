{"1":"Heare, O ye children, the instruction of a father, and giue eare to learne vnderstanding.","2":"For I doe giue you a good doctrine: therefore forsake yee not my lawe.","3":"For I was my fathers sonne, tender and deare in the sight of my mother,","4":"When he taught me, and sayde vnto me, Let thine heart holde fast my woordes: keepe my commandements, and thou shalt liue.","5":"Get wisedom: get vnderstading: forget not, neither decline from the woordes of my mouth.","6":"Forsake her not, and shee shall keepe thee: loue her and shee shall preserue thee.","7":"Wisedome is the beginning: get wisedome therefore: and aboue all thy possession get vnderstanding.","8":"Exalt her, and she shall exalt thee: she shall bring thee to honour, if thou embrace her.","9":"She shal giue a comely ornamet vnto thine head, yea, she shal giue thee a crowne of glorie.","10":"Heare, my sonne, & receiue my wordes, and the yeeres of thy life shalbe many.","11":"I haue taught thee in ye way of wisedom, and led thee in the pathes of righteousnesse.","12":"Whe thou goest, thy gate shal not be strait, and when thou runnest, thou shalt not fall.","13":"Take holde of instruction, and leaue not: keepe her, for shee is thy life.","14":"Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walke not in the way of euill men.","15":"Auoide it, and goe not by it: turne from it, and passe by.","16":"For they can not sleepe, except they haue done euill, and their sleepe departeth except they cause some to fall.","17":"For they eate the breade of wickednesse, and drinke the wine of violence.","18":"But the way of the righteous shineth as the light, that shineth more and more vnto the perfite day.","19":"The way of the wicked is as the darkenes: they knowe not wherein they shall fall.","20":"My sonne, hearken vnto my wordes, incline thine eare vnto my sayings.","21":"Let them not depart from thine eyes, but keepe them in the middes of thine heart.","22":"For they are life vnto those that find them, and health vnto all their flesh.","23":"Keepe thine heart with all diligence: for thereout commeth life.","24":"Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lippes farre from thee.","25":"Let thine eyes beholde the right, and let thine eyeliddes direct thy way before thee.","26":"Ponder the path of thy feete, and let all thy waies be ordred aright.","27":"Turne not to the right hande, nor to the left, but remooue thy foote from euill."}
