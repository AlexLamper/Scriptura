{"1":"My sonne, hearken vnto my wisedome, & incline thine eare vnto my knowledge.","2":"That thou maiest regarde counsell, and thy lippes obserue knowledge.","3":"For the lippes of a strange woman drop as an honie combe, and her mouth is more soft then oyle.","4":"But the end of her is bitter as wormewood, and sharpe as a two edged sworde.","5":"Her feete goe downe to death, and her steps take holde on hell.","6":"She weigheth not the way of life: her paths are moueable: thou canst not knowe them.","7":"Heare yee me nowe therefore, O children, and depart not from the wordes of my mouth.","8":"Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not neere the doore of her house,","9":"Least thou giue thine honor vnto others, and thy yeeres to the cruell:","10":"Least the stranger should be silled with thy strength, and thy labours bee in the house of a stranger,","11":"And thou mourne at thine end, (when thou hast consumed thy flesh and thy bodie)","12":"And say, How haue I hated instruction, and mine heart despised correction!","13":"And haue not obeied the voyce of them that taught mee, nor enclined mine eare to them that instructed me!","14":"I was almost brought into all euil in ye mids of the Congregation and assemblie.","15":"Drinke the water of thy cisterne, and of the riuers out of the middes of thine owne well.","16":"Let thy fountaines flow foorth, and the riuers of waters in the streetes.","17":"But let them bee thine, euen thine onely, and not the strangers with thee.","18":"Let thy fountaine be blessed, and reioyce with the wife of thy youth.","19":"Let her be as the louing hinde and pleasant roe: let her brests satisfie thee at all times, and delite in her loue continually.","20":"For why shouldest thou delite, my sonne, in a strange woman, or embrace the bosome of a stranger?","21":"For the waies of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.","22":"His owne iniquities shall take the wicked himselfe, and he shall be holden with the cordes of his owne sinne.","23":"Hee shall die for faute of instruction, and shall goe astraie through his great follie."}
