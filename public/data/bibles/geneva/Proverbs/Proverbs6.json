{"1":"My sonne, if thou be surety for thy neighbour, and hast striken hands with the stranger,","2":"Thou art snared with the wordes of thy mouth: thou art euen taken with the woordes of thine owne mouth.","3":"Doe this nowe, my sonne, and deliuer thy selfe: seeing thou art come into the hande of thy neighbour, goe, and humble thy selfe, and sollicite thy friends.","4":"Giue no sleepe to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.","5":"Deliuer thy selfe as a doe from the hande of the hunter, and as a birde from the hande of the fouler.","6":"Goe to the pismire, O sluggarde: beholde her waies, and be wise.","7":"For shee hauing no guide, gouernour, nor ruler,","8":"Prepareth her meat in the sommer, & gathereth her foode in haruest.","9":"Howe long wilt thou sleepe, O sluggarde? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleepe?","10":"Yet a litle sleepe, a litle slumber, a litle folding of the hands to sleepe.","11":"Therefore thy pouertie commeth as one that trauaileth by the way, and thy necessitie like an armed man.","12":"The vnthriftie man and the wicked man walketh with a froward mouth.","13":"He maketh a signe with his eyes: he signifieth with his feete: he instructeth with his fingers.","14":"Lewde things are in his heart: he imagineth euill at all times, and raiseth vp contentions.","15":"Therefore shall his destruction come speedily: hee shall be destroyed suddenly without recouerie.","16":"These sixe things doeth the Lorde hate: yea, his soule abhorreth seuen:","17":"The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that shed innocent blood,","18":"An heart that imagineth wicked enterprises, feete that be swift in running to mischiefe,","19":"A false witnesse that speaketh lyes, and him that rayseth vp contentions among brethren.","20":"My sonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forsake not thy mothers instruction.","21":"Binde them alway vpon thine heart, and tye them about thy necke.","22":"It shall leade thee, when thou walkest: it shall watch for thee, when thou sleepest, and when thou wakest, it shall talke with thee.","23":"For the commandement is a lanterne, and instruction a light: and corrections for instruction are the way of life,","24":"To keepe thee from the wicked woman, & from ye flatterie of ye tongue of a strange woman.","25":"Desire not her beautie in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye lids.","26":"For because of the whorish woman a man is brought to a morsell of bread, and a woman wil hunt for the precious life of a man.","27":"Can a man take fire in his bosome, and his clothes not be burnt?","28":"Or can a man go vpon coales, and his feete not be burnt?","29":"So he that goeth in to his neighbours wife, shall not be innocent, whosoeuer toucheth her.","30":"Men do not despise a thiefe, when he stealeth, to satisfie his soule, because he is hungrie.","31":"But if he be founde, he shall restore seuen folde, or he shall giue all the substance of his house.","32":"But he that committeth adulterie with a woman, he is destitute of vnderstanding: he that doeth it, destroyeth his owne soule.","33":"He shall finde a wounde and dishonour, and his reproch shall neuer be put away.","34":"For ielousie is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.","35":"He cannot beare the sight of any raunsome: neither will he consent, though thou augment the giftes."}
