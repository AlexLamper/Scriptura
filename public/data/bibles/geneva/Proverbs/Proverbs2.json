{"1":"My sonne, if thou wilt receiue my wordes, and hide my commandements within thee,","2":"And cause thine eares to hearken vnto wisdome, and encline thine heart to vnderstanding,","3":"(For if thou callest after knowledge, and cryest for vnderstanding:","4":"If thou seekest her as siluer, & searchest for her as for treasures,","5":"Then shalt thou vnderstand the feare of the Lord, and finde the knowledge of God.","6":"For the Lorde giueth wisdome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderstanding.","7":"He preserueth the state of the righteous: he is a shielde to them that walke vprightly,","8":"That they may keepe the wayes of iudgement: and he preserueth the way of his Saintes)","9":"Then shalt thou vnderstand righteousnes, and iudgement, and equitie, and euery good path.","10":"When wisdome entreth into thine heart, and knowledge deliteth thy soule,","11":"Then shall counsell preserue thee, and vnderstanding shall keepe thee,","12":"And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that speaketh froward things,","13":"And from them that leaue the wayes of righteousnes to walke in the wayes of darkenes:","14":"Which reioyce in doing euill, and delite in the frowardnesse of the wicked,","15":"Whose wayes are crooked and they are lewde in their paths.","16":"And it shall deliuer thee from the strange woman, euen from the stranger, which flattereth with her wordes.","17":"Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the couenant of her God.","18":"Surely her house tendeth to death, and her paths vnto the dead.","19":"All they that goe vnto her, returne not againe, neither take they holde of the wayes of life.","20":"Therefore walke thou in the way of good men, and keepe the wayes of the righteous.","21":"For the iust shal dwell in the land, and the vpright men shall remaine in it.","22":"But the wicked shalbe cut off from ye earth, and the transgressours shalbe rooted out of it."}
