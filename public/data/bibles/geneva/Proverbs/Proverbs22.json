{"1":"A good name is to be chosen aboue great riches, and louing fauour is aboue siluer and aboue golde.","2":"The rich and poore meete together: the Lord is the maker of them all.","3":"A prudent man seeth the plague, and hideth himselfe: but the foolish goe on still, and are punished.","4":"The rewarde of humilitie, and the feare of God is riches, and glory, and life.","5":"Thornes and snares are in the way of the frowarde: but he that regardeth his soule, will depart farre from them.","6":"Teache a childe in the trade of his way, and when he is olde, he shall not depart from it.","7":"The rich ruleth the poore, and the borower is seruant to the man that lendeth.","8":"He that soweth iniquitie, shall reape affliction, and the rodde of his anger shall faile.","9":"He that hath a good eye, he shalbe blessed: for he giueth of his bread vnto the poore.","10":"Cast out the scorner, and strife shal go out: so contention and reproche shall cease.","11":"Hee that loueth purenesse of heart for the grace of his lippes, the King shalbe his friend.","12":"The eyes of the Lorde preserue knowledge: but hee ouerthroweth the wordes of the transgressour.","13":"The slouthfull man saith, A lyon is without, I shall be slaine in the streete.","14":"The mouth of strage women is as a deepe pit: he with whom the Lord is angry, shall fall therein.","15":"Foolishnesse is bounde in the heart of a childe: but the rodde of correction shall driue it away from him.","16":"Hee that oppresseth the poore to increase him selfe, and giueth vnto the riche, shall surely come to pouertie.","17":"Incline thine eare, and heare the wordes of the wise, and apply thine heart vnto my knowledge.","18":"For it shalbe pleasant, if thou keepe them in thy bellie, and if they be directed together in thy lippes.","19":"That thy confidence may be in the Lord, I haue shewed thee this day: thou therefore take heede.","20":"Haue not I written vnto thee three times in counsels and knowledge,","21":"That I might shewe thee the assurance of the wordes of trueth to answere the wordes of trueth to them that sende to thee?","22":"Robbe not the poore, because hee is poore, neither oppresse the afflicted in iudgement.","23":"For the Lord will defende their cause, and spoyle the soule of those that spoyle them.","24":"Make no friendship with an angrie man, neither goe with the furious man,","25":"Least thou learne his wayes, and receiue destruction to thy soule.","26":"Be not thou of them that touch the hand, nor among them that are suretie for debts.","27":"If thou hast nothing to paye, why causest thou that he should take thy bed from vnder thee?","28":"Thou shalt not remooue the ancient bounds which thy fathers haue made.","29":"Thou seest that a diligent man in his businesse standeth before Kings, and standeth not before the base sort."}
