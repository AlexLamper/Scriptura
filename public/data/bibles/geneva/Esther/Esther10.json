{"1":"And the King Ahashuerosh layd a tribute vpon the land, and vpon the yles of the sea.","2":"And all the actes of his power, and of his might, & the declaration of the dignitie of Mordecai, wherwith the King magnified him, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia?","3":"For Mordecai the Iewe was the second vnto King Ahashuerosh, & great among the Iewes, and accepted among the multitude of his brethren, who procured the wealth of his people, and spake peaceably to all his seede."}
