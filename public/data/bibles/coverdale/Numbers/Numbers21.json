{"1":"And whan Arad the kynge of the Cananites (which dwelt towarde the south) herde, that Israel came in by ye waie yt the spyes had founde out, he fought agaynst Israel, and toke some of them presoners.","2":"Then vowed Israel a vowe vnto ye LORDE, and sayde: Yf thou wylt geue this people vnder my hande, I wyll vtterly destroye their cities.","3":"And the LORDE herde ye voyce of Israel, and delyuered them the Cananites, and they vtterly destroyed them wt their cities also. And he called the place Horma.","4":"Then departed they fro mount Hor on ye waye towarde the reed see, that they might go aboute the lande of the Edomites. And the soules of the people faynted by the waie","5":"and they spake agaynst God and agaynst Moses: Wherfore hast thou brought vs out of the lande of Egipte, to slaye vs in the wildernesse? For here is nether bred ner water, and oure soule lotheth this lighte meate.","6":"Than sent the LORDE fyrie serpentes amonge the people, which bote the peple, so that there dyed moch people in Israel.","7":"The came they vnto Moses, and sayde: We haue synned, because we haue spoken agaynst the LORDE and agaynst the. Praye thou vnto the LORDE, that he take awaye the serpentes from vs. And Moses prayed for the people.","8":"Then sayde the LORDE vnto Moses: Make the a brasen serpente, and set it vp for a token. Who so euer is bytten, and loketh vpon it, shal lyue.","9":"Then made Moses a serpent of brasse, and set it vp for a token: and whan a serpent had bytten eny man, he behelde the brasen serpente, and recouered.","10":"And the children of Israel departed, and pitched in Oboth.","11":"And from Oboth they wente on, and pitched in Igim by Abarim in the wyldernesse ouer agaynst Moab, on the Eastsyde.","12":"From thence departed they, & pitched by the ryuer of Sared.","13":"From thence departed they, and pitched on this syde Arnon, which is in the wyldernesse, and commeth out of the coastes of the Amorites. For Arnon is the border betwixte Moab and ye Amorites.","14":"Wherfore it is spoken in the boke of the warres of the LORDE: And go with violence both on the ryuer of Arnon,","15":"& on the founteyne of the riuer, which boweth downewarde to dwell at Ar, & leaneth theron, to be the border of Moab.","16":"And from thence they came to the well. This is the well, wherof the LORDE spake vnto Moses: gather the people together, I wil geue them water.","17":"Then sange Israel this songe, and they sange one after another ouer the well:","18":"This is the well, that the prynces dygged: the nobles amonge the people haue digged it thorow ye teacher and their staues. And from this wildernes they wente vnto Mathana,","19":"& from Mathana vnto Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,","20":"and fro Bamoth vnto the valley that lieth in ye felde of Moab at the toppe of Pisga, and turneth towarde the wyldernesse.","21":"And Israel sent messaungers vnto Siho the kynge of the Amorrites, & caused to saye vnto him:","22":"Let me go thorow ye lande, we wyl not turne in to ye feldes ner in to the vynyardes: nether will we drynke the water of the welles, ye hye strete wil we go, till we be past the borders of thy countre.","23":"Howbeit Sihon wolde not geue the children of Israel licence to go thorow the coastes of his londe, but gathered all his people together, and wente out agaynst Israel in the wyldernesse. And whan he came to Iaheza, he fought agaynst Israel.","24":"Neuerthelesse Israel smote him with the edge of the swerde, and conquered his lande from Arnon vnto Iabock, and vnto the children of Ammon. For the borders of the children of Ammon were stroge.","25":"So Israel toke all these cities, and dwelt in all the cities of ye Amorites, namely at He?bon, and in the townes belonginge therto.","26":"For He?bon the cite was Sihons the kynge of the Amorites, and he had foughten before with the kynge of the Moabites, and conquered all his londe from him vntyll Arnon.","27":"Wherfore it is sayde in the prouerbe: Come vnto He?bon, let vs buylde and prepare ye cite of Sihon.","28":"For there is a fyre gone out of He?bon, and a flamme from the cite of Sihon, which hath consumed Ar of ye Moabites, and the citisens of ye toppe of Arnon.","29":"Wo vnto the Moab, thou people of Camos art vndone. His sonnes are put to flighte, & his doughters brought captyue vnto Sihon the kynge of the Amorites.","30":"Their glory is come to naught from He?bon vnto Dibon: waisted are they vnto Nopha, which reacheth vnto Mediba.","31":"Thus dwelt Israel in the lande of the Amorites.","32":"And Moses sent out spyes vnto Iahesar, & they toke the townes belongynge therto, & coquered the Amorites yt were therin.","33":"And they turned, & wente vp the waye towarde Basan. Then Og the kynge of Basan wete out agaynst them wt all his people, to fight in Edrei.","34":"And ye LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Feare him not, for I haue geuen him wt his lande & people in to thy hande, & thou shalt do with him, as thou dyddest with Sihon the kynge of the Amorites, which dwelt at He?bon.","35":"And they smote him, & his sonnes, & all his people (so yt there remayned none) & coquered the londe."}
