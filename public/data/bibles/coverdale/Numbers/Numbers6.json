{"1":"And the LORDE talked with Moses, and sayde:","2":"Speake vnto the children of Israel, and saye vnto them: Whan a man or woman separateth them selues, to vowe a vowe of abstinence vnto the LORDE,","3":"he shal absteyne from wyne and stroge drynke. Vyneger of wyne & of stronge drynke shal he not drynke, ner that is pressed out of grapes: he shall nether eate fresh ner drye grapes, so longe as his abstinence endureth.","4":"Morouer he shall eate nothinge that is made of the vyne tre, from the wyne cornels vnto the hulle.","5":"As longe as the vowe of his abstynence endureth, there shall no rasoure come vpon his heade, tyll the tyme be out which he absteyneth vnto the LORDE, for he is holy. And he shall let the heer of his heade growe, and stonde bare openly.","6":"All the tyme ouer yt he absteyneth vnto the LORDE, shal he go to no deed.","7":"Nether shal he defyle him self at ye death of his father, of his mother, of his brother, or of his sister. For the abstinence of his God is vpon his heade,","8":"and ye whole tyme of his abstinence shall he be holy vnto the LORDE.","9":"And yf it chaunce eny man to dye sodenly before him, then shal ye heade of his abstynence be defyled. Therfore shal he shaue his heade in the daye of his clensynge, that is vpon the seuenth daye:","10":"and vpon ye eight daye shall he brynge two turtill doues, or two yonge pigeons, vnto the prest before ye dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse.","11":"And the prest shall make the one a synofferynge, and the other a burntofferynge, and make an attonement for him, because he defyled himself vpon ye deed, and so shal he halowe his heade the same daye,","12":"that he maye holde out the tyme of his abstinence vnto the LORDE, and he shall brynge a lambe of a a yeare olde for a trespaceofferynge. But ye daies afore shal be but lost, because his abstinence was defyled.","13":"This is the lawe of the absteyner. Whan the tyme of his abstinence is out, he shal be brought before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse.","14":"And he shal brynge his offeringe vnto the LORDE, euen an he lambe of a yeare olde without blemysh for a burntofferinge, & a she lambe of a yeare olde without blemysh for a synofferynge, and a ramme wt out blemish for an healthofferynge,","15":"& a maude wt vnleuended cakes of fyne floure myngled with oyle, and swete wafers anoynted with oyle, & their meatofferinges & drynkofferynges.","16":"And the prest shall brynge it before the LORDE, and shal make his synofferynge and his burntofferynge,","17":"and ye ramme shal he make an healthofferynge vnto the LORDE, with ye maunde of the vnleuended bred. His meatofferynge and drinkofferinge shal he make also.","18":"And he shall shaue the heade of the absteyners abstinence before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, and shall take the heade heer of his abstinence, and cast it vpon the fyre that is vnder ye healthofferynge.","19":"And the sodden shulder of the ramme shall he take, and an vnleuended cake out of the maunde, and a swete wafer, and laye them vpon the handes of the absteyner: (after that he hath shauen of his abstinence.)","20":"And he shal Waue them before the LORDE. This is holy for the prest with the Wauebrest, and Heueshulder. After that, maye the absteyner drynke wyne.","21":"This is the lawe of the absteyner, which voweth his offeringe vnto the LORDE for his abstynence, besydes that, which his hande can get. As he hath vowed, so shall he do acordinge to the lawe of his abstinence.","22":"And the LORDE talked with Moses, and sayde:","23":"Speake vnto Aaron and his sonnes, and saye: Thus shal ye saye vnto the childre of Israel, whan ye blesse them.","24":"The LORDE blesse the, and kepe the.","25":"The LORDE make his face to shyne vpo the, and be mercifull vnto the.","26":"The LORDE lift vp his countenaunce vpon the, and geue the peace.","27":"For they shal put my name vpo the children of Israel, that I maye blesse them."}
