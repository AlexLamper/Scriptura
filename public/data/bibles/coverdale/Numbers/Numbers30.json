{"1":"And Moses spake vnto the rulers of the trybes of the children of Israel, and saide: This is that the LORDE hath commauded:","2":"Yf eny man make a vowe vnto the LORDE, or sweare an ooth, so that he binde his soule, he shal not breake his worde, but do all that is proceaded out of his mouth.","3":"Yf a damsell make a vowe vnto ye LORDE, and bynde hirself, whyle she is in hir fathers house, and vnmaried,","4":"and hir vowe or bonde that she maketh ouer hir soule, commeth to hir fathers eares, & he holde his peace therto, the all hir vowes & bondes yt she hath boude hir self withall ouer hir soule, shal stode in effecte.","5":"But yf hir father forbyd her ye same daye that he heareth it, the shal no vowe ner bonde that she hath bounde hir self withall ouer hir soule, be of vayle. And the LORDE shalbe mercifull vnto her, for so moch as hir father forbad her.","6":"Yf she haue an hu?bande, & hath a vowe vpon her, or yf she haue letten go out of hir lippes a bode ouer hir soule,","7":"& hir hu?bande heare it, & holdeth his peace ther at, the same daye that he heareth it, then hir vowe & bonde wherwith she hath boude hir self ouer hir soule, shal stonde in effecte.","8":"But yf hir hu?bande forbyd her the same daye that he heareth it, the is the vowe lowse yt she hath vpo hir, & the bonde also that she hath letten go out of hir lippes ouer hir soule, and the LORDE shalbe gracious vnto her.","9":"The vowe of a wyddowe, & of her yt is deuorced, all yt she byndeth hir self withall ouer hir soule, shal stonde in effecte vpo her.","10":"Yf she vowe in hir hu?bades house, or binde hir self wt an ooth ouer hir soule,","11":"& hir husbande heare it, & holde his peace therto, and forbyddeth it not, the shal all ye same vowe, & all yt she hath boude hir self wt all ouer hir soule, stode i effecte.","12":"But yf hir hu?bade disanulle it, ye same daye yt he heareth it, the is it of no value yt is proceaded out of hir lippes, which she hath vowed or boude ouer hir soule: for hir hu?bade hath made it lowse, & the LORDE shalbe gracious vnto her.","13":"And all vowes & oothes yt bynde to humble ye soule, maie hir hu?bade stablish or breake, thus:","14":"Yf he holde his peace therto fro one daie to another, then stablisheth he all hir vowes & bondes, yt she hath vpon her, because he helde his peace, the same daye yt he herde the.","15":"But yf he disanulle the after yt he hath herde the, then shal he take awaie hir mi?dede.","16":"These are the statutes yt the LORDE comaunded Moses betwene a man & his wife, & betwene the father & his doughter, whyle she is yet a damsell in hir fathers house."}
