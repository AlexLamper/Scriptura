{"1":"Morouer, the worde of ye LORDE came vnto me, & sayde:","2":"Thou sonne of man, wilt thou not reproue this bloudthurstie cite? Shewe the their abhominacios,","3":"& tell them: Thus saieth the LORDE God: O thou cite, yt sheddest bloude in ye myddest of the, yt thy tyme maye come also: and makest the Idols to defyle the withall.","4":"Thou hast made thy self gilty, in ye bloude yt thou hast shed: & defyled ye i ye ydols, which thou hast made. Thou hast caused thy daies to drawe nye, & made the tyme of thy yeares to come. Therfore will I make ye to be confounded amoge the Heithe, & to be despised in all the lodes,","5":"whether they be nye or farre fro the: they shal laugh ye to scorne, thou yt hast gotte the so foule a name, & art full off myschefe.","6":"Beholde, the rulers of Israel haue brought euery man his power, to shed bloude in the.","7":"In the haue they despised father & mother, in the haue they oppressed the strauger, in the haue they vexed the wyddowe & the fatherlesse.","8":"Thou hast despysed my Sactuary, and vnhalowed my Sabbath.","9":"Murtherers are there in the, that shed bloude, & eate vpon the hilles, and in the they vse vnhappynesse.","10":"In ye haue they discouered their fathers shame, in the haue they vexed women in their sicknesse.","11":"Euery ma hath dealte shamefully with his neghbours wife, & abhominably defyled his doughter in lawe. In the hath euery man forced his owne sister, euen his fathers doughter:","12":"Yee giftes haue bene receaued in the, to shed bloude. Thou hast taken vsury & encreace, thou hast oppressed thy neghbours by extorcion, and forgotten me, saieth the LORDE God.","13":"Beholde, I haue smytten my hondes vpo thy couetousnesse, that thou hast vsed, and vpon the bloude which hath bene shed in the.","14":"Is thy herte able to endure it, or maye thy hondes defende them selues, in the tyme that I shall bringe vpon the? Euen I the LORDE that speake it, will bringe it also to passe.","15":"I will scatre the amonge the Heithen, & strowe the aboute in the lodes, and wil cause thy fylthynesse to ceasse out off the:","16":"yee and I will haue the in possession in the sight of the Heithen, that thou mayest knowe, that I am the LORDE,","17":"And the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:","18":"Thou sonne of man, the house of Israel is turned to drosse. C All they that shulde be brasse, tynne, yro & leade, are in the fyre become drosse.","19":"Therfore, thus saieth the LORDE God: For so moch as ye all are turned in to drosse, beholde: I will brynge you together vnto Ierusalem,","20":"like as syluer, brasse, yron, tynne and leade are put together in the fornace, and the fyre blowen there vnder to melt them: Euen so will I gather you, put you in together, and melt you in my wrath and indignacion.","21":"I will brynge you together, and kyndle the fyre of my cruell displeasure vnder you, that ye maye be melted therin.","22":"Like as the syluer is melted in the fyre, so shall ye also be melted therin: that ye maye knowe, how that I the LORDE haue poured my wrath vpon you.","23":"And the worde off the LORDE came vnto me, sayege:","24":"Thou sonne of ma, tell her: Thou art an vn clene londe, which is not rayned vpon in the daye off the cruell wrath:","25":"thy prophetes that are in the, are sworne together to deuoure soules, like as a roaringe Lyon, that lyueth by his pray. They receaue riches and good, and make many wyddowes in ye.","26":"Thy prestes breake my lawe, and defyle my Sanctuary. They put no dyfference betwene the holy and vnholy, nether discerne betwene the clene and vnclene: they turne their eyes fro my Sabbathes, and I am vnhalowed amonge them.","27":"Thy rulers in the are like rauyshinge wolues, to shed bloude, and to destroye soules, for their owne covetous lucre.","28":"As for thy prophetes, they dawbe with vntempered claye, they se vanities, and prophecie lies vnto them, sayenge: the LORDE God sayeth so, where as the LORDE hath not spoken","29":"The people in the londe vseth wicked extorcio and robbery. They vexe the poore and nedy: and oppresse the straunger agaynst right.","30":"And I sought in the londe for a man, that wolde make vp the hedge, and set him self in the gappe before me in the lodes behalfe, yt I shulde not vtterly destroye it: but I coude fynde none.","31":"Therfore wil I poure out my cruell displeasure vpon them, and burne them in the fyre of my wrath: their owne wayes will I recompence vpo their heades, saieth the LORDE God."}
