{"1":"The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:","2":"Thou sonne of man: What commeth of the vyne amonge all other trees? and of the wyne stocke, amoge all other tymbre of the groaue?","3":"Do me take wodd of it, to make eny worke withall? Or maye there a nale be made of it, to hange eny thinge vpon?","4":"Beholde, it is cast in the fyre to be brent, the fyre consumeth both the endes of it, the myddest is brent to a?shes. Is it mete then for eny worke? No.","5":"Seinge then, that it was mete for no worke, beinge whole: moch lesse maye there eny thinge be made of it, when the fyre hath consumed and brent it.","6":"And therfore thus saieth the LORDE God: Like as I cast the vyne in to the fyre for to be brent, as other trees of the wod: Euen so wil I do with them that dwell in Ierusalem,","7":"and set my face agaynst them: they shall go out from the fyre, and yet the fyre shall consume them. Then shal ye knowe, that I am the LORDE, when I set my face agaynst them,","8":"and make the londe waist: because they haue so sore offended, saieth the LORDE God."}
