{"1":"The honde of the LORDE came vpon me, & caried me out in the sprete of the LORDE, & let me downe in a playne felde, that laye full of bones,","2":"& he led me rounde aboute by them: & beholde, the bones that laye vpon the felde, were very many, & maruelous drye also.","3":"Then sayde he vnto me: Thou sonne of man: thinkest thou these bones maye lyue agayne? I answered: O LORDE God, thou knowest.","4":"And he sayde vnto me: Prophecy thou vpon these bones, & speake vnto them: Ye drye bones, heare the worde of the LORDE.","5":"Thus saieth the LORDE God vnto these bones: Beholde, I will put breth in to you, that ye maye lyue:","6":"I wil geue you synowes, & make flesh growe vpon you, & couer you ouer with skynne: & so geue you breth, that ye maye lyue, and knowe, that I am the LORDE.","7":"So I prophecied, as he had comaunded me. And as I was prophecienge, there came a noyse and a greate mocion, so that the bones ranne euery one to another.","8":"Now whe I had loked, beholde, they had synowes, and flesh grewe vpon them: and aboue they were couered with skynne, but there was no breth in them.","9":"Then sayde he vnto me: Thou sonne of man, prophecie thou towarde the wynde: prophecy, and speake to the wynde: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Come (o thou ayre) from the foure wyndes, & blowe vpon these slayne, that they maye be restored to life.","10":"So I prophecied, as he had commaunded me: Then came the breth tnto them, and they receaued life, and stode vp vpon their fete, a maruelous greate sorte.","11":"Morouer, he sayde vnto me: Thou sonne of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Beholde, they saye: oure bones are dryed vp, oure hope is gone, we are clene cut of.","12":"Therfore prophecie thou, & speake vnto them. Thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I wil open youre graues (o my people) & take you out of youre sepulcres, & bringe you in to the londe of Israel agayne.","13":"So shall ye knowe yt I am the LORDE, when I open youre graues, & bringe you out of them.","14":"My sprete also wil I put in you, & ye shal lyue: I wil set you agayne in youre owne londe, and ye shal knowe, that I am the LORDE, which haue sayde it, and fulfilled it in dede.","15":"The worde of the LORDE came vnto me, sayenge:","16":"Thou sonne of man, take a sticke and wryte vpon it: Vnto Iuda & to the children of Israel his companyons. Then take another sticke, and wryte vpon it: Vnto Ioseph the stocke of Ephraim, and to all the housholde of Israel his companyons.","17":"And than take both these together in thine honde, so shal there be one stycke therof.","18":"Now yf the childre of thy people saye vnto the: wilt thou not shewe vs, what thou meanest by these?","19":"Then geue them this answere: Thus saieth the LORDE God: Beholde, I wil take the stocke of Ioseph, which is in the honde of Ephraim and of the trybes of Israel his felowes, and wil put them to the stocke of Iuda, & make them one stocke, and they shalbe one in my honde.","20":"And the two stickes where vpon thou wrytest, shalt thou haue in thine honde, that they maye se,","21":"and shalt saye vnto them: Thus saieth the LORDE God: beholde I wil take awaye the childre of Israel from amonge the Heithen, vnto whom they be gone, and wil gather them together on euery syde, and bringe them agayne in to their owne londe:","22":"yee I wil make one people of the in ye londe, vpon the mountaynes of Israel, and they all shal haue but one kinge. They shall nomore be two peoples from hensforth, nether be deuyded in to two kingdomes:","23":"they shal also defyle the selues nomore with their abhominacions, Idols and all their wickeddoinges. I wil helpe the out of all their dwellinge places, wherin they haue synned: & will so clense them, that they shalbe my people, and I their God.","24":"Dauid my seruaunt shalbe their kinge, & they all shal haue one shepherde only. They shal walke in my lawes, and my commaundementes shalt they both kepe & fulfill.","25":"They shal dwell in the londe, that I gaue vnto Iacob my seruaunt, where as youre fathers also haue dwelt. Yee eue in the same londe shal they, their children, & their childers children dwell for euermore: and my seruaunt Dauid shal be their euerlastynge prynce.","26":"Morouer, I will make a bonde of peace with them, which shal be vnto them an euerlastinge couenaunt. I wil sattle the also, and multiplie them, my Sanctuary wil I set amonge the for euermore.","27":"My dwellinge shalbe wt them, yee I wil be their God, & they shalbe my people.","28":"Thus the Heithen also shal knowe, that I the LORDE am ye holy maker of Israel: whe my Sanctuary shal be amonge them for euer more."}
