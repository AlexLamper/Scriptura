So when men sawe that she exceaded ye heith and multitude of hir braunches,","12":"she was roted out in displeasure, and cast downe to the grounde. The East wynde dryed vp hir frute, hir stronge stalkes were broken of, wythered and brent in the fyre.","13":"But now she is planted in the wildernesse, in a drye and thurstie grounde.","14":"And there is a fyre gone out of hir stalkes, which hath bret vp hir braunches and hir frute: so that she hath no mo stronge stalkes, to be staues for officers. This is a piteous and miserable thinge."}
