{"1":"It happened, that in the sixte yeare, the fifth daye of the sixte Moneth I sat in my house, and the LORDES off the councell off Iuda with me: and the honde off the LORDE God fell euen there vpo me.","2":"And as I loked vp, I sawe as it were a licknesse off fyre from his loynes downwarde, and from his loynes vpwarde it shyned maruelous cleare.","3":"This symilitude stretched out an honde, and toke me by the hayrie lockes off my heade, and the sprete lift me vp betwixte heauen and earth: and God brought me in a vision to Ierusalem, in to the courte off the inwarde porte that lieth towarde the north: there stode an ymage, with whom he that hath all thinges in his power, was very wroth.","4":"And beholde, the glory off the God off Israel was in the same place: eue as I had sene it afore in the felde.","5":"And he sayde vnto me: Thou sonne off man, O lift vp thine eyes, and loke towarde the north. Then lift I vp myne eyes towarde the north, and beholde: Besyde the porte northwarde, there was an aulter made vnto the ymage off prouocacion in the very entrynge in.","6":"And he sayde furthermore vnto me: Thou sonne off man, Seist thou what these do? Seist thou the greate abhominacions that the house off Israel commytte in this place? which ought not to be done in my sanctuary? But turne the aboute, and thou shalt se yet greater abhominacions.","7":"And with that brought he me to the courte gate: and whe I loked, beholde, there was an hole in the wall.","8":"Then sayde he vnto me: Thou sonne off man, dygge thorow the wall. And when I dygged thorow the wall, beholde, there was a dore.","9":"And he sayde vnto me: go thy waye in, & loke what wicked abhominacions they do there.","10":"So I wente in, and sawe: and beholde, there were all maner ymages off wormes & beastes, all Idols and abhominacions of ye house off Israel paynted euerychone rounde aboute the wall.","11":"There stode also before the ymages lxx. lordes of the councell off the house off Israel: and in the myddest off them stode Iaasanias the sonne off Saphan: And euery one off them had a censoure in his honde, & out off the incense, there wente a smoke, as it had bene a cloude.","12":"Then sayde he vnto me: Thou sonne off man, hast thou sene what the Senatours off the house off Israel do secretly, euery one in his chambre? For they saye: Tush, the LORDE seth vs not, the LORDE regardeth not the worlde.","13":"And he sayde vnto me: Turne the yet agayne, and thou shat se the greate abhominacions that they do.","14":"And with that, he brought me to the dore off the porte off the LORDES house, towarde the north. And beholde, there sat women mournynge for Thamus.","15":"Then sayde he vnto me: hast thou sene this, thou sonne of ma? Turne ye aboute, & thou shalt se yet greater abhominacions.","16":"And so he brought me in to the inwarde courte of the LORDES house: & beholde, at the porte of the LORDES house, betwixte the fore entrie and the aulter, there were fyue and twenty men, that turned their backes vpon the Temple of the LORDE, & their faces towarde the easte, and these worshipped the Sonne.","17":"And he sayde vnto me: hast thou sene this, thou sonne of man? Thinketh the house of Israel, that it is but a trifle, to do these abhominacions here? Shulde they fyll the londe full of wickednesse, and vndertake to prouoke me vnto anger? Yee & purposly to cast vp their noses vpon me?","18":"Therfore wil I also do some thinge in my wrothfull displeasure, so that myne eye shall not ouersee them, nether wil I spare them. Yee and though they crie in myne eares with loude voyce, yet wil I not heare them."}
