But yff he will receaue warnynge, he shal saue his life.","6":"Agayne, yf the watch man se the swerde come, and shewe it not with the trompet, so yt the people is not warned: yff the swearde come then, and take eny man from amoge the: the same shall be taken awaye in his owne synne, but his bloude will I requyre off the watchmans honde.","7":"And now (O thou sonne of man) I haue made the a watchman vnto the house of Israel: that where as thou hearest eny thinge out of my mouth, thou mayest warne them on my behalfe.","8":"Yff I saye vnto the wicked: thou wicked, thou shalt surely dye: and thou geuest him not warnynge, that he maye bewarre off his vngodly waye: then shall the wicked dye in his owne synne, but his bloude will I requyre of thy honde.","9":"Neuertheles yf thou warne the wicked off his waye, to turne from it, where as he yet wil not be turned from it: then shal he dye because off his synne, but thou hast delyuered thy soule.","10":"Therfore (O thou sonne off man) speake vnto the house off Israel, Ye saye thus: Oure offences and synnes lye vpon vs, and we be corrupte in them: how shulde we then be restored vnto life?","11":"Tell them: As truly as I lyue (saieth the LORDE God) I haue no pleasure in the death off the wicked, but moch rather that the wicked turne from his waye and lyue. Turne you, turne you from yor vngodly wayes, o ye off the house off Israel. Oh, wherfore will ye dye?","12":"Thou sonne off man, tell the children off thy people: The rightuousnes of the rightuous shall not saue him, whan so euer he turneth awaye vnfaithfully: Agayne, the wickednesse of the wicked shal not hurte him, whan so euer he conuerteth from his vngodlynesse: And ye rightuousnesse of the rightuous shal not saue his life, when so euer he synneth.","13":"Yff I saye vnto the rightuous, that he shall surely lyue, and so he trust to his owne rightuousnesse, and do synne: then shall his rightuousnesse be nomore thought vpon, but in the wickednesse that he hath done, he shall dye.","14":"Agayne, yff I saye to the wicked: thou shalt surely dye: and so he turne fro his synnes, and do the thinge that is laufull and right:","15":"In so moch that the same wicked ma geueth the pledge agayne, restoreth that he had taken awaye by robbery, walketh in the comaundementes off life, and doth no wroge: Then shall he surely lyue, and not dye.","16":"Yee the synnes that he had done, shal neuer be thought vpon: For in so moch as he doth now the thynge that is laufull and right, he shall lyue.","17":"And yet the children off thy people saye: Tush, the waye of the LORDE is not right, where as their owne waye is rather vnright.","18":"When the rightuous turneth from his rightuousnesse, and doeth the thynge that is wicked, he shall dye therfore.","19":"But yf the wicked turne from his wickednesse, doinge the thinge that is laufull and right, he shall lyue therfore.","20":"Yet ye saye: the waye of ye LORDE is not equall.
