Besyde all these thre there stode pilers, one ouer against another:","4":"And before this chabre there was a walkinge place of x. cubites wyde, and within was a waye of one cubite wyde, and their dores towarde the north.","5":"Thus the hyest chambres were allwaye narower then the lowest and myddelmost of ye buildinge:","6":"for they bare chambre vpon chambre, and stode thre together one vpon another, not hauynge pilers like the fore courte: therfore were they smaller then those beneth and in the myddest, to reken from the grounde vpwarde.","7":"The wall without that stode by ye chambres towarde the vttemost courte vpon the fore syde of the chambres, was L. cubites loge:","8":"for the legth of ye vttemost chambers in the fore courte was L. cubites also: but the length therof before the temple was an C. cubites.","9":"These chambres had vnder them an intraunce of the east syde, wherby a man might go into them out of the fore courte,","10":"thorow the thicke wall of the fore courte towarde the east, right ouer agaynst the separated buyldinge.","11":"Before the same buyldinge vpo this syde there were chabers also which, had a waye vnto them, like as the chambers on the north syde of the same length and wydenesse.
