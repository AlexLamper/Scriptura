{"1":"God in tyme past dyuersly & many wayes, spake vnto ye fathers by prophetes,","2":"but in these last dayes he hath spoken vnto vs by his sonne, whom he hath made heyre of all thinges, by whom also he made the worlde.","3":"Which (sonne) beynge the brightnes of his glory, & the very ymage of his substaunce, bearinge vp all thinges with the worde of his power, hath in his owne personne pourged oure synnes, and is set on the righte hande of the maiestie on hye:","4":"beynge eue as moch more excellet the ye angels, as he hath optayned a more excellet name then they.","5":"For vnto which of the angels sayde he at eny tyme: Thou art my sonne, this daye haue I begotten the? And agayne: I will be his father, & he shalbe my sonne:","6":"And agayne, wha he bryngeth in the fyrst begotte sonne in to the worlde, he sayeth: And all the angels of God shal worshippe him.","7":"And of the angels he sayeth: He maketh his angels spretes, & his mynisters flames of fyre.","8":"But vnto ye sonne he sayeth: God, yi seate endureth for euer & euer: the cepter of yi kyngdome is a right cepter.","9":"Thou hast loued righteousnes, & hated iniquyte: wherfore God (which is thy God) hath anoynted the with the oyle of gladnesse aboue yi felowes.","10":"And thou LORDE in ye begynnynge hast layed the foundacion of the earth, and ye heaues are the workes of thy handes,","11":"they shal perishe, but thou shalt endure: they all shal waxe olde as doth a garmet,","12":"and as a vesture shalt thou chaunge them, and they shalbe chaunged. But thou art ye same, and thy yeares shal not fayle.","13":"Vnto which of the angels sayde he at eny tyme: Syt thou on my righte hade, tyll I make thyne enemies thy fote stole?","14":"Are they not all mynistrynge spretes, sent to mynister for their sakes, which shalbe heyres of saluacion?"}
