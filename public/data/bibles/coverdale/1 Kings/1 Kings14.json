Speake thou therfore vnto her thus & thus Now whan she came in, she shewed hirselfe straunge.","6":"But whan Ahias herde the noyse of hir fete goynge in at the dore, he saide: Come in thou wyfe of Ieroboa. Why shewest thou thy selfe so straunge? I am sent vnto ye an harde messaunger.","7":"Go thy waye and tell Ieroboam: Thus sayeth ye LORDE God of Israel: I haue exalted the from amonge the people, and set the to be prynce ouer my people of Israel,","8":"and haue rente the kyngdome from the house of Dauid, and geuen it the.
