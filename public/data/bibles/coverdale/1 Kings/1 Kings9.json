{"1":"And whan Salomon had fynished ye buyldinge of the house of the LORDE, and the kynges house, and all that his desyre and pleasure was to make,","2":"ye LORDE appeared vnto him the seconde tyme, euen as he appeared vnto him at Gibeon.","3":"And the LORDE sayde vnto him: I haue herde thy prayer and peticion, that thou hast made before me, and haue sanctified this house which thou hast buylded, that I maye set my name there for euer: and myne eyes and my hert shalbe there allwaye.","4":"And yf thou walke before me (as thy father Dauid walked) with a perfecte and a true hert, so that thou do all that I haue commaunded the, and kepe myne ordinaunces and lawes,","5":"then wyll I stablish the seate of thy kyngdome ouer Israel for euer, acordinge as I promysed thy father Dauid, and sayde: Thou shalt not wante a man from the seate of Israel.","6":"But yf ye turne back fro me, ye and youre childre, and kepe not my commaundementes and ordinaunces which I haue layed before you, but go and serue other goddes, and worshipe them,","7":"then wyll I rote Israel out of the londe that I haue geuen them. And the house that I haue halowed vnto my name, wyll I put awaye fro my face. And Israel shall be come a byworde and fabell amoge all nacions,","8":"and so shal this hye house: so that euery one yt goeth by, shall be astonyed, and make an hyssynge, and saye: Wherfore hath the LORDE done thus vnto this londe and to this house?","9":"Then shal it be answered: Because they forsoke ye LORDE their God, (which brought their fathers out of the londe of Egipte) and haue receaued other goddes, and worshipped them, and serued them. Therfore hath ye LORDE brought all this euell vpon them.","10":"Now whan the twentye yeares were ended, wherin Salomon buylded the two houses, the LORDES house and the kynges house,","11":"where vnto Hiram the kynge of Tyre brought Salomo Ceder trees & Pyne trees, and golde after all his desyre, then gaue kynge Salomon vnto Hiram twentye cities in the countre of Galile.","12":"And Hiram departed from Tyre to vyset the cities which Salomon had geuen him, & they pleased him not,","13":"and he sayde: What maner of cities are these (my brother) that thou hast geue me? And he called them the londe of Cabul vnto this daye.","14":"And Hiram vnto the kynge, sixe score hundreth weight of Golde.","15":"And the same is the summe of the taxe, that kynge Salomon raysed to the buyldinge of the house of the LORDE, and his awne house, & Millo, and the walles of Ierusalem, and Hasor, and Megiddo, and Gaser.","16":"For Pharao ye kynge of Egipte came vp, and wane Gaser, & brent it with fyre, & slewe the Cananites yt dwelt in the cite, & gaue it for a gifte vnto his doughter Salomos wife.","17":"So Salomon buylded Gaser, & the lower Bethoron,","18":"and Baelath and Thamar, in ye wyldernes, in the londe,","19":"& all the cities of the corne houses that Salomon had, and all the cities of the charettes, & all the cities of the horsmen, and what it pleased him to buylde at Ierusalem, in Libanus, & in euery countre of his domynion.","20":"And all the remnaunt of the people of the Amorytes, Hethites, Pheresites, Heuites and Iebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,","21":"their children which they lefte behynde them in the londe (whom the children of Israel coulde not vtterly destroye) those dyd Salomon make tributaries vnto this daye.","22":"But of the children of Israel he made no bondmen, but let them be men of warre, and his seruauntes, and prynces, and knightes, and ouer his charettes and horsme.","23":"And the officers which were ouer Salomons busynesse, were fyue hundreth and fyftye, which ruled the people, and perfourmed the worke.","24":"And Pharaos doughter wente vp from the cite of Dauid, in to hir house which he had buylded for her. Then buylded he Millo likewyse.","25":"And thre tymes in the yeare dyd Salomon offre burntofferynges and deedofferynges vpon the altare that he had buylded vnto the LORDE, and burnt incense vpon it before the LORDE, and so was the house ended and fynished.","26":"And Salomon made shippes also at Ezeon Geber, which lyeth by Eloth besyde the Reed See shore in ye londe of the Edomites.","27":"And Hiram sent his seruauntes by shippe, which were shipmen, and had experience of the See, with Salomons seruauntes,","28":"and they came vnto Ophir, and fetched from thence one & twenty score hundreth weight of golde, and brought it vnto Salomon."}
