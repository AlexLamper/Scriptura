{"1":"And the LORDE called Moses, and spake vnto him out of ye Tabernacle of wytnesse, and sayde:","2":"Speake vnto ye childre of Israel, & saie vnto them: Who so euer amoge you wyl brynge an offerynge vnto the LORDE, let him brynge it of ye catell, euen of the oxen, & of the shepe.","3":"Yf he wyl brynge a burntofferynge of ye oxen (or greate catell) the let him offre a male without blemysh, before ye dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse, to reconcyle himself before the LORDE,","4":"let him laye his hande vpon the heade of the burntofferynge, then shal he be reconcyled, so yt God shalbe mercifull vnto him.","5":"And he shall kyll the yonge oxe before ye LORDE: and ye prestes Aarons sonnes shal brynge the bloude, and sprenkle it rounde aboute vpon the altare, that is before the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse.","6":"And the skynne shalbe flayne from of the burntofferynge, and it shalbe hewen in peces.","7":"And the sonnes of Aaron the prest shal make a fyre vpon the altare,","8":"and laye wod aboue theron: and ye peces, the heade, and the fatt shal they laye vpon the wodd that lyeth vpon ye fyre on the altare.","9":"But ye bowels & legges shal be wasshen with water, and the prest shal burne alltogether vpon the altare for a burntsacrifice: this is an offerynge of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE.","10":"Yf he wyl offre a burntsacrifice of the small catell, that is, of the lambes or goates, then let him offre a male without a blemysh.","11":"And he shall kyll it before the LORDE, euen at the corner of the altare on the north syde before ye LORDE. And (the prestes) Aarons sonnes shal sprenkle his bloude rounde aboute vpon ye altare,","12":"and it shal be hewen in peces. And the prest shall laye them with the heade and the fatt, vpon the wodd that lyeth vpon the fyre on the altare.","13":"But the bowels and ye legges shal be wasshen with water. And ye prest shal offre it alltogether, and burne it vpon ye altare for a burntsacrifice. This is an offerynge of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE.","14":"But yf he wil offre a burntsacrifice of ye foules vnto the LORDE, then let him offre it of the turtill doues or of ye yonge pigeons.","15":"And the prest shal brynge it vnto the altare, and wrynge the neck of it a sunder, that it maye be burnt vpon the altare, and let the bloude of it runne out vpon the sydes of the altare,","16":"and the croppe of it with the fethers shalbe cast vpon the heape of asshes besyde the altare towarde the east,","17":"and he shall deuyde the wynges of it, but not breake the cleane of. And thus shall the prest burne it vpon the altare, euen vpon the wodd that lyeth vpo the fyre, for a burntsacrifice. This is an offerynge of a swete sauoure vnto the LORDE."}
