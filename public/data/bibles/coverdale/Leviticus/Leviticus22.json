{"1":"And the LORDE talked with Moses, & sayde:","2":"Speake vnto Aaron, & his sonnes, yt they absteyne from ye halowed thinges of the childre of Israel, which they haue halowed vnto me, & yt they vnhalowe not my holy name: for I am ye LORDE.","3":"Saie now vnto them & their posterities: Who so euer he be of yor sede, yt commeth nye vnto the holy thinges, which the childre of Israel halowe vnto the LORDE, & so defyleth him self vpon the same, his soule shal perishe before my face: for I am the LORDE.","4":"Who so euer of the sede of Aaron is a leper, or hath a runnynge yssue, shall not eate of the holy thinges, tyll he be clensed. Who so toucheth eny vncleane thinge, or whose sede departeth from him by night,","5":"or who so toucheth eny worme that is vncleane vnto him, or a ma yt is vncleane vnto him,","6":"& what so euer defyleth hi, loke what soule toucheth eny soch, is vncleane vntyll the euen, & shall not eate of the holy thinges, but shall first bath his flesh with water.","7":"And wha ye Sonne is gone downe, and he cleane, then maye he eate therof, for it is his foode.","8":"Loke what dyeth alone, or is rent of wylde beestes, shall he not eate, yt he be not vncleane theron: for I am ye LORDE.","9":"Therfore shal they kepe my lawe, yt they lade not synne vpon them, & dye therin, whan they vnhalowe them selues in it. For I am ye LORDE, yt halowe them.","10":"A straunger shal not eate of the holy thinges, ner an housholde gest of the prestes, ner an hyred seruaut.","11":"But yf ye prest bye a soule for his money, ye same maye eate therof. And loke who is borne in his house, maye eate of his bred also.","12":"Neuertheles yf the prestes doughter be a straungers wife, she shal not eate of the Heueofferinges of holynes.","13":"But yf she be a wedowe, or deuorced, or haue no sede, & commeth agayne to hir fathers house as a fore (whan she was yet a mayden in hir fathers house) then shall she eate of hir fathers bred. But no strauger shal eate therof.","14":"Who so els eateth of the halowed thynges, vnwyttingly, shal put ye fifth parte there vnto, and geue it vnto the prest with the halowed thinge,","15":"that they vnhalowe not ye halowed thinges of the children of Israel, which they Heue vp vnto the LORDE,","16":"lest they lade them selues with mysdoinge and trespace, wha they eate their halowed thynges, for I am ye LORDE which halowe the.","17":"And ye LORDE talked wt Moses, & saide:","18":"Speake vnto Aaron & his sonnes, & to all ye childre of Israel: What so euer Israelite or straunger in Israel wyll do his offerynge, whether it be their vowe, or of fre wyl, that they wyll offre a burntofferynge vnto the LORDE,","19":"to reconcyle them selues, it shal be a male, and without blemysh, of the oxen, or lambes or goates.","20":"What so euer hath eny blemish, shal they not offre, for they shal fynde no fauoure therwith.","21":"And who so wyl offre an health offeringe vnto the LORDE to separate out a vowe, or of fre wyl, oxen or shepe, it shalbe without blemysh, yt it maye be accepted. It shal haue no deformite.","22":"Yf it be blynde, or broke, or wounded, or haue a wen, or skyrvye, or scabbed, they shal offre none soch vnto the LORDE, ner put an offerynge of eny soch vpo the altare of the LORDE.","23":"An oxe or shepe yt hath mysshappe membres, or no rompe, mayest thou offre of a fre wyll: but to a vowe it maye not be accepted.","24":"Thou shalt offre also vnto the LORDE nothinge yt is brused, or broken, or rent, or cutt out, & ye shal do no soch in youre londe.","25":"Morouer ye shall offre no bred vnto youre God of a straungers hande: for it is marred of him, and he hath a deformite, therfore shal it not be accepted for you.","26":"And the LORDE spake vnto Moses, & sayde:","27":"Wha an oxe, or labe, or goate is brought forth, it shal be seuen dayes with the dame, and vpon the eight daye & therafter it maie be offered vnto the LORDE, the is it accepted.","28":"Whether it be oxe or lambe, it shall not be slayne with his yonge in one daye.","29":"But wha ye wil offre a thakoffringe vnto the LORDE yt it maye be accepted,","30":"ye shal eate it the same daye, & kepe nothinge ouer vntyll the mornynge: for I am the LORDE.","31":"Therfore kepe now my commaundementes, and do them: for I am the LORDE,","32":"yt ye vnhalowe not my holy name, & that I maye be halowed amonge the children of Israel. For I am he that halowe you, eue ye LORDE,","33":"which brought you out of ye lode of Egipte, yt I might be yor God: Euen I ye LORDE."}
