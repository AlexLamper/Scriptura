They shal nether be gathered together ner buried, but shal lye vpo the earth, to their shame and despisinge.","3":"And all they that remayne of this wicked generacion, shal desyre rather to dye the to lyue: where so euer they remayne, & where as I scatre them, saieth the LORDE of hoostes.","4":"This shalt thou saye vnto them also: Thus saieth the LORDE: Do men fall so, that they arise not vp agayne: And turne they so farre awaye, yt they neuer conuerte?","5":"Wherfore then is this people and Ierusalem gone so farre backe, that they turne not againe? They are euer the longer the more obstinate, and will not be conuerted.","6":"For I haue loked, and considered: but there is no ma, that speaketh a good worde: there is no man, that taketh repetaunce for his synne, that will so moch as saye: wherfore haue I done this? But euery man (as soone as he is turned backe) runneth forth still, like a wilde horse in a battayl.","7":"The Storke knoweth his apoynted tyme, the Turtledoue, ye Swalow and the Crane, cosidre the tyme of their trauayle: but my people will not knowe the tyme of the punyshment of the LORDE.","8":"How darre ye saye then: we are wise, we haue the lawe of the LORDE amonge vs?

For from the lowest vnto the hyest, they folowe all shamefull lucre: and from the prophet vnto the prest, they deale all with lies.","11":"Neuertheles, they heale the hurte of my people with swete wordes, sayenge: peace, peace, where there is no peace at all.","12":"Fye for shame, how abhominable thinges do they? And yet they be not ashamed, yee they knowe of no shame. Wherfore in the tyme of their visitacion, they shal fall amonge the deed bodies, saieth the LORDE.","13":"Morouer I will gather them in (saieth the LORDE) so that there shal not be one grape vpon the vyne, nether one fyge vpon the fyge tre, and the leaues shalbe plucte of.
