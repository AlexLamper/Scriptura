{"1":"These are the wordes, that the LORDE spake vnto Ieremy the prophet agaynst the Phylistines, before that Pharao smote the cite off Gaza.","2":"Thus saieth the LORDE: Beholde, there shall waters arise out off the north: and shall growe to a greate floude, runnynge ouer and couerynge the londe, the cities and them that dwell therin. And the men shall crie, and all they that dwell in the londe, shall mourne","3":"at the noyse and stampynge off their stronge barded horses, at the shakynge off their charettes, and at the romblinge off the wheles. The fathers shall not loke to their children, so feable and weery shall their hondes be:","4":"at the same tyme, when he shal be there, to destroye the whole londe off the Phylistynes. He shall make waist both Tirus, Sidon ad all other that are sworne vnto them. For the LORDE will destroye all Palestina, and the other Iles, that be deuyded fro the countre.","5":"Baldnesse is come vpon Gaza, Ascalon with hir other valleys shall kepe hir peace. How longe wilt thou slaye,","6":"O thou swearde off the LORDE? Turne agayne in to ye sheeth, reste, and leaue off.","7":"But how can it ceasse, when the LORDE himselff hath geuen it a charge agaynst Ascalon, and raysed it vp agaynst the cities off the see coast?"}
