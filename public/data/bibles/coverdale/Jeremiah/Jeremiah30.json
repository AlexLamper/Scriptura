{"1":"These are the wordes, that the LORDE shewed vnto Ieremy, saienge:","2":"Thus saieth the LORDE God of Israel: Wryte vp diligently all the wordes, that I haue spoken vnto the, in a boke","3":"For lo, the tyme commeth (saieth the LORDE) that I will bringe agayne the presoners of my people of Israel and Iuda, saieth the LORDE: For I will restore them vnto the londe, that I gaue to their fathers, and they shall haue it in possession.","4":"Agayne, these wordes spake the LORDE, cocernynge Israel and Iuda:","5":"Thus saieth the LORDE: We heare a terrible crie, feare and disquietnesse.","6":"For what els doth this signifie, that I se? Namely, that all stronge men smyte, euery man his honde vpon his loynes, as a woman in the payne of hir trauayle. Who euer sawe a man trauayle with childe? Enquere therafter, & se. Yee all their faces are maruelous pale.","7":"Alas for this daye, which is so dredefull, that none maye be lickened vnto it: and alas for the tyme of Iacobs trouble, from the which he shall yet be delyuered.","8":"For in that daye, saieth the LORDE, I will take his yock from of thy neck, & breake thy bondes. They shall nomore serue straunge goddes vnder him,","9":"but they shall do seruyce vnto God their LORDE, and to Dauid their kinge, whom I will rayse vp vnto them.","10":"And as for the, o my seruaunt Iacob, feare not (saieth ye LORDE) and be not afrayed, o Israel. For lo, I will helpe the also from farre, & thy sede from the londe of their captiuyte. And Iacob shall turne agayne, he shalbe in rest, and haue a prosperous life, and no man shall make him afrayed.","11":"For I am with the, to helpe the, saieth the LORDE. And though I shal destroye all the people, amonge whom I haue scatred the, yet will I not destroye the, but correcke the, and that with discrecion. For I knowe, that thou art in no wise without faute.","12":"Therfore thus saieth ye LORDE: I am sory for thy hurte and woundes.","13":"There is no man to medle with thy cause, or to bynde vp thy woundes: there maye no man helpe the.","14":"All thy louers haue forgotten the, and care nothinge for the. For I haue geuen the a cruell stroke, and chastened the roughly: and that for the multitude of thy my?dedes, for thy synnes haue had the ouer hande.","15":"Why makest thou mone for thy harme? I my self haue pite of thy sorowe, but for the multitude of thy my?dedes and synnes, I haue done this vnto the.","16":"And therfore all they that deuoure the, shalbe deuoured, and all thine enemies shalbe led in to captiuyte. All they that make the waist, shalbe waisted them selues: and all those that robbe the, will I make also to be robbed.","17":"For I will geue the thy health agayne, and make thy woundes whole, saieth the LORDE: because they reuyled the, as one cast awaye and despised, o Sion.","18":"For thus saieth the LORDE: Beholde, I will set vp Iacobs tentes agayne, and defende his dwellinge place. The cite shalbe buylded in hir olde estate, and the houses shal haue their right foundacion.","19":"And out of them shall go thankesgeuynge, and the voyce of ioye. I will multiplie them, and they shall not mynishe: I shall endue them with honoure, and no man shall subdue them.","20":"Their children shalbe as afore tyme, and their congregacion shal cotinue in my sight. And all those that vexe them, will I viset.","21":"A captayne also shall come of them, and a prynce shall springe out from the myddest of them: him will I chalenge to myself, and he shall come vnto me. For what is he, that geueth ouer his herte, to come vnto me? saieth the LORDE.","22":"Ye shalbe my people also, and I wilbe youre God.","23":"Beholde, on the other syde shall the wrath of the LORDE breake out as a stormy water, as a mightie whyrle wynde: and shal fall vpo the heades of the vngodly.","24":"The terrible displeasure of the LORDE shall not leaue of, vntill he haue done, & perfourmed the intent of his herte, which in the latter dayes ye shal vnderstonde."}
