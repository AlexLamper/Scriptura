{"1":"Morouer the worde of the LORDE came vnto Ieremy on this maner, whe he was yet bounde in the courte of the preson:","2":"Thus saieth the LORDE, which fulfilleth the thinge that he speaketh the LORDE which perfourmeth the thinge that he taketh in honde: euen he, whose name is the LORDE:","3":"Thou hast cried vnto me, and I haue herde the: I haue shewed greate and hie thinges, which were vnknowne vnto you.","4":"Thus (I saye) spake the LORDE God of Israel, concernynge the houses of this cite, and the houses of the kinges of Iuda: that they shalbe broken thorow the ordinaunce and weapens,","5":"when the Caldees come to besege them: and they shalbe fylled with the deed carcases of men, whom I will slaye in my wrath and displeasure: whe I turne my face from this cite, because of all hir wickednes.","6":"Beholde, (saieth the LORDE) I will heale their woundes, and make them whole: I will open them the treasure of peace and treuth.","7":"And I will returne the captiuyte of Iuda and Israel: and will set them vp agayne, as they were afore.","8":"From all my?dedes (wherin they haue offended agaynst me) I will clese them: And all their blasphemies which they haue done agaynst me, when they regarded me not, I will forgeue them.","9":"And this shal get me a name, a prayse and honoure, amonge all people of the earth, which shall heare all the good, that I will shewe vnto them: Yee they shall be afrayed and astonnied at all the good dedes and benefites, that I will do for them.","10":"Morouer, thus saieth the LORDE: In this place, wherof ye saye that it shalbe a wildernesse, wherin nether people ner catell shal dwell: In like maner in the cities of Iuda and without Ierusalem (which also shalbe so voyde, that nether people ner catell shall dwell there)","11":"Shal the voyce of gladnesse be herde agayne, the voyce of the brydegrome and of the bryde, the voyce of them that shall synge: (Prayse the LORDE of hoostes, for he is louynge, and his mercy endureth for euer) and the voyce of them that shall offre vp giftes in the house of the LORDE. For I will restore the captiuyte of this londe, as it was afore, saieth the LORDE.","12":"Thus saieth the LORDE of hoostes. It shall come yet therto, that in this londe, which is voyde from men and catell, and in all the cities of the londe, there shal be set vp shepherdes cotages:","13":"in the cities vpon the mountaynes, and in the cities that lie vpon the playne, and in the deserte. In the londe of BenIamin, in the feldes of Ierusalem, and in the cities of Iuda shal the shepe be nombred agayne, vnder the honde of him, that telleth them, saieth the LORDE.","14":"Beholde, the tyme commeth (saieth the LORDE) that I wil perfourme that good thinge, which I haue promised vnto the house of Israel and to the house of Iuda.","15":"In those daies and at the same tyme, I will bringe forth vnto Dauid, the braunch of rightuousnes, and he shall do equite and rightuousnesse in the londe.","16":"In those daies shall Iuda be helped, and Ierusalem shall dwell safe, and he that shall call her is euen God oure rightuous maker.","17":"For thus the LORDE promyseth: Dauid shal neuer want one, to syt vpon the stole of the house of Israel:","18":"nether shall the prestes and Leuites want one to offre all waye before me, burntofferinges, to kyndle the meatofferinges, & to prepare the sacrifices.","19":"And the worde of the LORDE came vnto Ieremy after this maner:","20":"Thus saieth the LORDE: Maye the couenaunt which I haue made with daye and night, be broken, that there shulde not be daye and night in due season?","21":"Then maye my couenaunt also be broken, which I made with Dauid my seruaunt, and so he not to haue a sonne to reigne in his Trone. So shall also the prestes and Leuites neuer fayle, but serue me.","22":"For like as the starres of heauen maye not be nombred, nether the sonde of the see measured: so will I multiplie the sede of Dauid my seruaunt, and of the Leuites my ministers.","23":"Morouer, the worde of the LORDE came to Ieremy, saienge:","24":"Cosidrest thou not what this people speaketh? Two kynreddes (saye they) had the LORDE chosen, & those same two hath he cast awaye. For so farre is my people come, yt they haue no hope to come together eny more, and to be one people agayne.","25":"Therfore thus saieth the LORDE: Yf I haue made no couenaunt with daye & night, and geue no statute vnto heauen and earth:","26":"then will I also cast awaye the sede of Dauid my seruaunt: so that I wil take no prynce out of his sede, to rule the posterite of Abraha, Isaac and Iacob. But yet I will turne agayne their captiuyte, and be mercifull vnto them."}
