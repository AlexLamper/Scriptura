{"1":"O ye folishe Galathias, who hath bewitched you, that ye shulde not beleue the trueth? To who Iesus Christ was descrybed before the eyes and amonge you crucified.","2":"This onely wolde I lerne of you: Receaued ye the sprete by the dedes of the lawe, or by the preachinge of the faith?","3":"Are ye so vnwyse? Ye beganne in the sprete, wolde ye ende now the in the flesh?","4":"Haue ye suffred so moch in vayne? Yf it be els in vayne.","5":"He that geueth you the sprete, and doth soch greate actes amoge you, doth he it thorow the dedes of the lawe, or by ye preachinge of the faith?","6":"Euen as Abraha beleued God, and it was counted vnto him for righteousnes.","7":"Thus ye knowe, that they which are of faith, are Abrahams children.","8":"The scripture sawe afore hade, that God iustifieth the Heythen thorow faith. Therfore shewed it glad tydinges afore vnto Abraham, and sayde: In the shal all the Heythen be blessed.","9":"So then they which be of faith, are blessed with faithfull Abraham.","10":"For as many as go aboute with the workes of the lawe, are vnder ye curse: For it is wrytte: Cursed be euery man, which cotynueth not in all thinges that are wrytte in the boke of the lawe, to do them.","11":"That no man is iustified by the lawe in the sighte of God, it is euydet: For ye iust shal lyue by his faith.","12":"The lawe is not of faith, but the ma that doth ye same, shal lyue therin.","13":"But Christ hath delyuered vs from ye curse of the lawe, whan he became a curse for vs. (For it is wrytte: Cursed is euery man that hangeth on tre)","14":"yt the blessynge of Abraham mighte come on the Gentyles in Christ Iesu, and yt we might so receaue ye promysed sprete, thorow faith.","15":"Brethren, I wil speake after the maner of men. Though it be but a mas Testamet, yet no man despyseth it, or addeth eny thinge therto, whan it is confirmed.","16":"To Abraham and his sede were the promyses made. He sayeth not: In the sedes, as in many, but in thy sede, as in one, which is Christ.","17":"This Testament (I saye) which afore was confirmed to Christ warde, is not disanulled (that the promes shulde be made of none affecte) by the lawe which was geuen beyonde foure hundreth & thirtie yeares therafter.","18":"For yf the enheritaunce be gotten by the lawe, then is it not geuen by promes. But God gaue it frely vnto Abraham by promes.","19":"Wherfore the serueth the lawe? It was added because of trangression, tyll the sede came, to the which the promes was made. And it was geuen of angels, by the hande of the mediatoure.","20":"A mediatour is not a mediatour of one onely, but God is one.","21":"Is the lawe then agaynst the promyses of God? God forbyd. Howbeit yf there had bene geuen a lawe which coulde haue geue life, the no doute righteousnes shulde come of the lawe.","22":"But ye scripture hath shut vp all vnder synne, that ye promes shulde come by the faith on Iesus Christ, geue vnto the that beleue.","23":"Before faith came, we were kepte and shut vp vnder the lawe, vnto the faith which shulde afterwarde be declared.","24":"Thus ye lawe was or scolemaster vnto Christ, that we might be made righteous by faith.","25":"But now that faith is come, we are nomore vnder the scolemaster.","26":"For ye all are the children of God by the faith in Christ Iesu.","27":"For as many of you as are baptysed, haue put on Christ.","28":"Here is nether Iewe ner Greke: here is nether bode ner fre: here is nether man ner woman, for ye are all one in Christ Iesu.","29":"Yf ye be Christes, the are ye Abrahas sede and heyres acordynge to the promes."}
