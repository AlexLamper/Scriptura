{"1":"This is the heuy burthen of Niniue, which Naum of Elchos dyd wryte, as he sawe it.","2":"The LORDE is a gelous God, and a taker of vengeaunce: yee a taker of vegeaunce is ye LORDE, and wrothfull. The LORDE taketh vengeaunce of his enemies, and reserueth displeasure for his aduersaries.","3":"The LORDE suffreth longe, he is of greate power, & so innocent, that he leaueth no man fautlesse before him. The LORDE goeth forth in tempest and stormy wether, the cloudes are the dust of his fete.","4":"Whe he reproueth the see, he dryeth it vp, & turneth all the floudes to drye londe. Basan is desolate, Charmel and the pleasure of Libanus waisteth awaye.","5":"The mountaynes tremble for him, the hilles consume. At the sight of him, the earth quaketh: yee the whole worlde, and all that dwell therin.","6":"Who maye endure before his wrath? Or who is able to abyde his grymme displeasure? His anger taketh on like fyre, and the harde rockes burst in sunder before him.","7":"Ful gracious is the LORDE, and a stronge holde in tyme of trouble, he knoweth the that put their trust in him:","8":"when the floude renneth ouer, and destroyeth the place, and when the darcknesse foloweth still vpon his enemies.","9":"What do ye ymagin then agaynst the LORDE on this maner? (Tush, when he hath once made an ende, there shal come nomore trouble.)","10":"For like as the thornes that sticke together, and as the drye strawe, so shal the dronckardes be consumed together, euen when they be full.","11":"There come out of ye soch as ymagin myschefe, and geue vngracious councell agaynst the LORDE.","12":"Therfore thus saieth the LORDE: Let the be as wel prepared, yee and as many as they can, yet shal they be hewen downe, and passe awaye. And as for the, I wil vexe the, but not vtterly destroie the.","13":"And now wil I breake his rodde from thy backe, and burst thy bondes in sonder.","14":"But the LORDE hath geuen a commaundement cocernynge the, that there shall come nomore sede of thy name. The carued and casten ymages will I rote out of the house of thy god. Thy graue shal I prepare for the, and thou shalt be confounded.","15":"Beholde, vpon the mountaynes come the fete of him, that bryngeth good tydinges, & preacheth peace. O Iuda, kepe thy holy dayes, perfourme thy promyses: for Belial shal come no more in the, he is vtterly roted out."}
