Loke thou wel to the stretes, make thy loynes stronge, arme thy self with all thy myght:","2":"for the LORDE shal restore agayne the glory of Iacob, like as ye glory of Israel. The destroyers haue broken them downe, & marred the wyne braunches.","3":"The shylde of his giauntes glistereth, his men of warre are clothed in purple. His charettes are as fyre, when he maketh him forwarde, his archers are wel deckte & trimmed.","4":"The charettes rolle vpon the stretes, & welter in the hye wayes. They are to loke vpon like cressettes of fyre, and go swyftly, as the lightenynge.","5":"When he doth but warne his giauntes, they fall in their araye, & haistely they clymme vp the walles: yee the engyns of the warre are prepared all ready.","6":"The water portes shal be opened, and the kinges palace shall fall.","7":"The quene hir self shal be led awaye captyue, and hir gentilwomen shal mourne as the doues, & grone within their hertes.","8":"Niniue is like a pole full of water, but then shal they be fayne to fle.
