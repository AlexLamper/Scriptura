{"1":"Thus was heaue and earth fynished with all their hoost,","2":"and thus in the seuenth daye God ended his worke, which he had made, & rested in the seuenth daye from all his workes which he had made:","3":"And blessed the seuenth daye, & sanctified it, because yt in it he rested from all his workes, which God created and made.","4":"These are the generacions of heaue and earth whan they were created, in the tyme whan the LORDE God made heauen and earth:","5":"before there was eny twygg vpon earth, and or euer there grew eny grene herbe vpon the felde. For the LORDE God had yet sent no rayne vpon ye earth, nether was there eny man to tylle the earth.","6":"But there arose a myst from the earth, & watered all the londe.","7":"And ye LORDE God shope man eue of the moulde of the earth, & brethed in to his face ye breth of life. And so was man made a lyuynge soule.","8":"The LORDE God also planted a garde of pleasure in Eden, towarde ye east, and set man therin whom he had made.","9":"And the LORDE God caused to sprynge out of the earth all maner trees, pleasaut to loke vpo, and good to eate: and the tre of life in the myddest of the garden, and the tre of knowlege of good and euell.","10":"And out of Eden there wente a ryuer, to water the garden, and there deuyded it selfe into foure heade waters.","11":"The first is called Phison, which renneth aboute all the londe of Heuyla.","12":"And there is founde golde, (& the golde of that countre is precious,) and there is founde Bedellion, and the precious stone Onix.","13":"The second water is called Gihon, which runneth aboute the whole londe of ye Morias.","14":"The thirde water is called Hydeckell, which runneth towarde the east syde of ye Assirias. The fourth water is Euphrates.","15":"And the LORDE God toke man, & set him in the pleasaunt garden of Eden, to dresse it & to kepe it.","16":"And the LORDE God commaunded man, sayege: Thou shalt eate of all maner trees in ye garden:","17":"But of ye tre of knowlege of good and euell, shalt thou not eate. For loke in what daye so euer thou eatest therof, thou shalt dye the death.","18":"And the LORDE God sayde: It is not good yt ma shulde be alone. I wil make him an helpe, to beare him copany.","19":"And whan God the LORDE had made of the earth all maner beastes of the felde, & all maner foules vnder the heaue, he brought them vnto man, to se what he wolde call the: For as ma called all maner of liuinge soules, so are their names.","20":"And man gaue names vnto all maner catell, & vnto the foules vnder the heaue, and vnto all maner beastes of ye felde. But vnto man there was founde no helpe, to beare him company.","21":"Then the LORDE God caused an herde slepe to fall vpon man, and he slepte. And he toke out one of his rybbes, and (in steade therof) he fylled vp ye place with flesh.","22":"And the LORDE God made a woman, of ye rybbe that he toke out of man, and brought her vnto him.","23":"Then sayde man: This is once bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shalbe called woman, because she was take of man.","24":"For this cause shal a man leaue father and mother, and cleue vnto his wife, & they two shalbe one flesh.","25":"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."}
