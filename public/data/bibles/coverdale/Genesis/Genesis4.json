{"1":"Morouer Adam laye with Heua his wyfe, which coceaued & bare Cain, and sayde, I haue opteyned ye man of the LORDE.","2":"And she proceaded forth, & bare his brother Abell. And Abell became a shepherde, but Cain became an husbande man.","3":"And it fortuned after certaine daies, that Cain brought of the frute of the earth, an offrynge vnto ye LORDE.","4":"And Abell brought also of the firstlinges of his shepe, and of ye fat of them. And the LORDE had respecte vnto Abell and to his offerynge:","5":"but vnto Cain and his offerynge he loked not. Then was Cain exceadinge wroth, and his countenaunce chaunged.","6":"And the LORDE sayde vnto Cain: Why art thou angrie? and why doth thy countenaunce chaunge? Is it not so? that yf thou do well, thou shalt receaue it:","7":"but and yf thou do euell, thy synne lyeth open in the dore? Shal he then be subdued vnto the? and wilt thou rule him?","8":"And Cain talked with Abell his brother. And it happened, that whan they were in the felde, Cain arose agaynst Abell his brother, and slew him.","9":"Then sayde the LORDE vnto Cain: Where is Abell thy brother? He sayde: I can not tell. Am I my brothers keper?","10":"And he sayde: What hast thou done? The voyce of thy brothers bloude crieth vnto me out of the earth.","11":"And now shalt thou be cursed vpon the earth, which hath opened hir mouth, and receaued thy brothers bloude of thine hande.","12":"Whan thou tyllest ye grounde, she shall hensforth not geue hir power vnto the. A vagabunde and a rennagate shalt thou be vpon ye earth.","13":"And Cain sayde vnto ye LORDE: my synne is greater, then that it maye be forgeuen me.","14":"Beholde, thou castest me out this daye from out of ye londe, and from yi sight must I hyde myself, and must be a vagabunde and a rennagate vpon ye earth. And thus shal it go with me: that who so fyndeth me, shal slaye me.","15":"But the LORDE sayde thus vnto him: Who so euer slayeth Cain, it shalbe auenged seuenfolde. And the LORDE put a marck vpon Cain, that no man which founde him, shulde kyll him.","16":"So Cain wente out from ye face of the LORDE, and dwelt in the lande Nod, vpon the east syde of Eden.","17":"And Cain laye with his wyfe, which conceaued and bare Henoch. And he buylded a cite, and called it after the name of his sonne Henoch.","18":"And Henoch begat Irad, Irad begat Mahuiael. Mahuiael begat Mathusael. Mathusael begat Lamech.","19":"And Lamech toke him two wyues: ye one was called Ada, & the other Zilla.","20":"And Ada bare Iabel, of whom came they that dwelt in tentes and had catell.","21":"And his brothers name was Iuball: Of him came they that occupied harpes & pypes.","22":"And Zilla she also bare Tubalcain, a worker in all connynge poyntes of metall & yron. And Tubalcains sister was called Naema.","23":"And Lamech sayde vnto his wyues Ada and Zilla: Heare my voyce (ye wyues of Lamech) and herken vnto my wordes: for I haue slayne a man, and wounded my selfe: and (haue kylled) a yonge man, and gotte my self strypes.","24":"Cain shalbe aueged seue tymes: but Lamech seuen and seuentie tymes.","25":"Adam laye yet with his wyfe agayne, & she bare a sonne, and called him Seth. For God (sayde she) hath apoynted me another sede, for Abell, whom Cain slew.","26":"And Seth begat a sonne also, and called him Enos. At the same tyme beganne men to call vpon the name of the LORDE."}
