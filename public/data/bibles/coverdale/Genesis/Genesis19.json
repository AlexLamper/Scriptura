{"1":"In the euenynge came the two angels vnto Sodome. And Lot sat vnder the gate of the cite. And whe he sawe them, he rose vp for to mete them, and bowed him self downe to the grounde vpon his face,","2":"& sayde: Se lordes, turne in (I praye you) in to youre seruauntes house, and tarye all night: let youre fete be wasshen, so maye ye ryse tomorow by tymes, and go youre waye. Neuertheles they sayde: Nay, but we wyll byde in the stretes all night.","3":"Then compelled he them sore: and they turned in vnto him, and came in to his house. And he made them a feast, and baked swete cakes, and they ate.","4":"But before they wente to rest, the men of the cite of Sodome came and compased the house rounde aboute, yonge and olde, all the people from all quarters,","5":"and called Lot, and sayde vnto him: Where are the me that came vnto the to night? Bringe them out here vnto vs, that we maye knowe them.","6":"And Lot wente out at the dore vnto the, and shut the dore after him,","7":"and sayde: O brethren, do not so wickedly.","8":"Beholde, I haue two doughters, which yet haue knowne no man: them will I brynge out vnto you, do with them as it liketh you. Onely do nothinge vnto these men of God, for therfore are they come vnder the shadowe of my rofe.","9":"But they sayde: Come thou hither. Then sayde they: Camest not thou onely herin as a straunger, and wilt thou now be a iudge? Wel, we will deale worse with the the with them.And they pressed sore vpon ye man Lot. And whan they ranne to, and wolde haue broken vp the dore,","10":"the men put out their hondes, and pulled Lot vnto them in to the house, and shut to the dore.","11":"And the men at ye dore of the house were smytte with blyndnesse both small and greate, so that they coude not fynde the dore.","12":"And ye men saide vnto Lot: Hast thou yet here eny sonne in lawe, or sonnes or doughters? Who so euer belongeth vnto the in the cite, brynge him out of this place:","13":"for we must destroye this place, because the crye of them is greate before the LORDE, which hath sent vs to destroye them.","14":"Then wente Lot forth, and spake to his sonnes in lawe, which shulde haue maried his doughters, and sayde: O stonde vp, and get you out of this place, for the LORDE wyll destroye this cite. Neuertheles they toke it but for a sporte.","15":"Now whan the mornynge arose, the angels caused Lot to spede him, and sayde: Stonde vp, take thy wife & thy two doughters which are at hande, that thou also perishe not in the synne of this cite.","16":"But whyle he prolonged the tyme, the men caught him and his wife, and his two doughters by the hande (because the LORDE was mercifull vnto him,) and brought him forth, & set him without the cite.","17":"And whe they had brought him out, they sayde: Saue thy soule, and loke not behynde the, nether stonde thou in all this countre: Saue thy self vpon the mountayne, that thou perish not.","18":"Then sayde Lot vnto the: Oh no my LORDE,","19":"beholde, in as moch as thy seruaut hath founde grace in thy sight, now make ye mercy greate, which thou hast shewed vnto me, in that thou sauest my soule alyue. I can not saue my self vpon the mountayne. There might some mysfortune fall vpon me, that I shulde dye.","20":"Beholde, here is a cite by, that I maye flye vnto, and it is a litle one: let me saue myself there in. Is it not a litle one, that my soule maye lyue?","21":"Then sayde he vnto him: Beholde, I haue loked vpon the in this poynte also, that I will not ouerthrowe the cite, wherof thou hast spoken.","22":"Haist the, and saue thy self there: for I can do nothinge tyll thou be come thither. Therfore is the cite called Zoar.","23":"And the Sonne was vp vpon the earth, whan Lot came in to Zoar.","24":"Then the LORDE caused brymstone and fyre to rayne downe from the LORDE out of heauen vpon Sodoma and Gomorra,","25":"and ouerthrew those cities, the whole region, and all that dwelt in the cities, and that that grew vpon the earth.","26":"And his wife loked behynde her, and was turned into a pillar of salt.","27":"Abraham rose vp early in the mornynge, and gat him vnto the place, where he had stonde before the LORDE,","28":"and turned his face towarde Sodoma and Gomorra, and all ye londe of that countre, and loked. And beholde, there rose vp a smoke from ye countre, as it had bene ye smoke of a fornace.","29":"For whan God destroyed ye cities of the region, he thought vpon Abraham, and conueyed Lot out of the cities which he ouerthrew, wherin Lot dwelt.","30":"And Lot departed out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountaynes with both his daughters (for he was afrayed to tary at Zoar) and so remayned he in a caue wt both his daughters.","31":"Then sayde ye elder vnto the yonger: Oure father is olde, and there is not a man more vpon earth, that can come in vnto vs after the maner of all the worlde.","32":"Come therfore, let vs geue oure father wyne to drynke, and lye with him, that we maye saue sede of oure father.","33":"So they gaue their father wyne to drynke that same night. And the elder doughter wente in, and laye with hir father: and he perceaued it not, nether when she laye downe, ner when she rose vp.","34":"On the morow the elder sayde vnto the yonger: Beholde, yesternight laye I with my father: let vs geue him wyne to drynke this night also: that thou mayest go in and lye with him, that we maye saue sede of oure father.","35":"So they gaue their father wyne to drynke that night also: And the yonger arose like wyse, and laye with him: & he perceaued it not, nether when she laye downe, ner when she rose vp.","36":"Thus were both the doughters of Lot with childe by their father.","37":"And the elder bare a sonne, and called him Moab, of whom come ye Moabytes vnto this daye.","38":"And ye yonger bare a sonne also, and called him the sonne Ammi, of whom come the children of Ammon vnto this daye."}
