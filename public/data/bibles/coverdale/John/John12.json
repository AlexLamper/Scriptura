{"1":"Sixe dayes before Easter came Iesus vnto Bethanye, where Lazarus was, which was deed, whom Iesus raysed vp from the deed.","2":"There they made him a supper, and Martha serued. But Lazarus was one of them, that sat at the table with him.","3":"Then toke Mary a pounde of oyntment of pure and costly Nardus, and anoynted Iesus fete, & dryed his fete with hir heer. The house was full of the sauoure of the oyntment.","4":"Then sayde one of his disciples, Iudas Iscarioth Symons sonne, which afterwarde betrayed him:","5":"Why was not this oyntment solde for thre hundreth pens, and geuen to the poore?","6":"(This sayde he not that he cared for the poore, but because he was a thefe, and had the bagge, and bare that which was geue.)","7":"Then sayde Iesus: Let her alone, this hath she kepte agaynst the daye of my buryenge.","8":"For the poore haue ye allwaye with you, but me haue ye not allwaye.","9":"Then moch people of the Iewes had knowlege, that he was there, and they came not for Iesus sake onely, but also yt they might se Lazarus, whom he had raysed from the deed.","10":"But ye hye prestes were aduysed to put Lazarus to death also:","11":"because yt for his sake many of the Iewes wete awaye and beleued on Iesus.","12":"Vpon the nexte daye moch people which were come vnto the feast, whan they herde that Iesus came towarde Ierusalem,","13":"they toke braunches of palme trees, and wete out to mete him, and cryed: Hosianna, Blessed be he, that in the name of the LORDE commeth kynge of Israel.","14":"Iesus gat a yonge Asse, and rode theron, As it is wrytte:","15":"Feare not thou doughter of Sion, beholde, thy kynge cometh rydinge vpo an Asses foale.","16":"Neuertheles his disciples vnderstode not these thinges at the first, but whan Iesus was glorified, then remebred they that soch thinges were wrytte of him, and that they had done soch thinges vnto him.","17":"The people that was with him whan he called Lazarus out of ye graue and raysed him from the deed, commended the acte.","18":"Therfore the people met him, because they herde, that he had done soch a miracle.","19":"But the pharises sayde amonge them selues: Ye se, that we preuayle nothinge, beholde, all ye worlde runneth after him.","20":"There were certayne Grekes (amonge the that were come vp to Ierusale to worshipe at the feast)","21":"the same came vnto Philippe, which was of Bethsaida out of Galile, & prayed him, and sayde: Syr, we wolde fayne se Iesus.","22":"Philippe came, & tolde Andrew. And agayne, Philippe and Andrew tolde Iesus.","23":"Iesus answered the, and sayde: The houre is come, that the sonne of man must be glorified.","24":"Verely verely I saye vnto you: Excepte the wheatcorne fall in to the grounde, and dye, it bydeth alone: But yf it dye, it bryngeth forth moch frute.","25":"He that loueth his life, shal lose it: and he that hateth his life in this worlde, shal kepe it vnto life euerlastinge.","26":"He that wyl serue me, let him folowe me. And where I am, there shal my seruaunt be also: and he that serueth me, him shal my father honoure.","27":"Now is my soule heuy, and what shal I saye? Father, helpe me out of this houre. But therfore am I come in to this houre.","28":"Father, glorifye thy name. Then came there a voyce from heauen: I haue glorified it, and wyl glorifye it agayne.","29":"Then sayde the people that stode by and herde: It thondereth. Other sayde: An angell spake vnto him.","30":"Iesus answered, and sayde: This voyce came not because of me, but for youre sakes.","31":"Now goeth the iudgment ouer the worlde. Now shal the prynce of this worlde be thrust out.","32":"And I whan I am lift vp from the earth, wyl drawe all vnto me.","33":"(But this he sayde, to signifye, what death he shulde dye.)","34":"Then answered him the people: We haue herde in the lawe, that Christ endureth for euer: and how sayest thou then, that the sonne of man must be lift vp? Who is this sonne of man?","35":"Then sayde Iesus vnto them: The light is yet a litle whyle with you, walke whyle ye haue the light, that the darknesse fall not vpo you. He that walketh in the darknesse, woteth not whither he goeth.","36":"Beleue ye on the light, whyle ye haue it, that ye maye be the children of light. These thinges spake Iesus, and departed awaye, and hyd himself from them.","37":"And though he had done soch tokens before the, yet beleued they not on him,","38":"that the sayenge of Esay the prophet might be fulfylled, which he spake: LORDE, who beleueth oure preachinge? Or to whom is the arme of the LORDE opened?","39":"Therfore coulde they not beleue, for Esay saide agayne:","40":"He hath blynded their eyes, and hardened their hert, that they shulde not se with the eyes, ner vnderstonde with the hert, & shulde be conuerted, and he shulde heale them.","41":"This sayde Esay, whan he sawe his glory, and spake of him.","42":"Neuertheles many of the chefe rulers beleued on him, but because of the Pharises they wolde not be aknowne of it, lest they shulde be excommunicate,","43":"For they loued more the prayse with men, then with God.","44":"Iesus cryed and sayde: He that beleueth on me, beleueth not on me, but on him that sent me.","45":"And he that seyth me, seyth him yt sent me.","46":"I am come a light in to the worlde, that whosoeuer beleueth on me, shulde not byde in darknesse.","47":"And he that heareth my wordes and beleueth not, I iudge him not, for I am not come to iudge the worlde, but to saue the worlde.","48":"He that refuseth me, and receaueth not my wordes, hath one allready that iudgeth him. The worde that I haue spoken, that shall iudge him at the last daye,","49":"For I haue not spoken of my self: but the father that sent me, hath geuen me a commaundement, what I shulde do and saye.","50":"And I knowe that his commaundement is life euerlastinge. Therfore loke what I speake, that speake I eue so, as the father hath sayde vnto me."}
