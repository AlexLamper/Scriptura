{"1":"Iesus wente vnto mount Oliuete,","2":"and early in the mornynge came he agayne in to the temple, and all the people came vnto him. And he sat downe, and taught them.","3":"And ye scrybes and Pharises brought vnto him a woman taken in aduoutrye, and set her there openly,","4":"and sayde vnto him: Master, this woman was taken in aduoutrye, eue as the dede was adoynge.","5":"Moses in the lawe commaunded vs to stone soch. What sayest thou?","6":"This they sayde, to tempte him, that they might haue wherof to accuse him. But Iesus stouped downe, and wrote with his fynger vpo the grounde.","7":"Now whyle they contynued axynge him, he lift him self vp, and sayde vnto them: He that is amonge you without synne, let him cast the first stone at her.","8":"And he stouped downe agayne, and wrote vpon the grounde.","9":"But whan they herde that, they wente out, one after another: the eldest first, and left Iesus alone, and the woman stondinge before him.","10":"Iesus lift himself vp, and whan be sawe no man but the woman, he sayde vnto her: Woman, where are thine accusers? Hath noman condempned the?","11":"She sayde: LORDE, no man. Iesus sayde: Nether do I codempne the, Go thy waye, and synne nomore.","12":"Then spake Iesus agayne vnto them, and sayde: I am the light of the worlde. He that foloweth me, shal not walke in darknesse, but shal haue the light of life.","13":"Then sayde the Pharises vnto him: Thou bearest recorde of thy self, thy recorde is not true.","14":"Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them: Though I beare recorde of my self, yet my recorde is true: for I knowe whence I came, and whither I go: but ye can not tell whence I come, and whither I go.","15":"Ye iudge after the flesh, I iudge no man:","16":"but yf I iudge, my iudgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the father that hath sent me.","17":"It is wrytten also in youre lawe, that the testimony of two men is true.","18":"I am one that beare wytnesse of my self: And the father that sent me, beareth wytnes of me also.","19":"Then sayde they vnto him: Where is thy father? Iesus answered: Ye nether knowe me ner yet my father.Yf ye knewe me, ye shulde knowe my father also.","20":"These wordes spake Iesus vpon the Godschest, as he taught in the teple. And noman toke him, for his houre was not yet come.","21":"Then sayde Iesus agayne vnto them: I go my waye, and ye shal seke me, and shal dye in youre synnes: whither I go, thither can not ye come.","22":"Then sayde ye Iewes: Wyl he kyll him self then, that he sayeth: whither I go, thither can not ye come?","23":"And he sayde vnto them: Ye are from beneth, I am from aboue: Ye are of this worlde, I am not of this worlde.","24":"Therfore haue I sayde vnto you, that ye shal dye in youre synnes. For yf ye beleue not that I am he, ye shal dye in youre synnes.","25":"Then sayde they vnto him: Who art thou then? And Iesus sayde vnto the: Eue the very same thinge that I saye vnto you.","26":"I haue many thinges to saye and to iudge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and loke what I haue herde of him,that speake I before the worlde,","27":"Howbeit they vnderstode not, that he spake of the father.","28":"Then sayde Iesus vnto them: Whan ye haue lift vp an hye the sonne of man, then shal ye knowe that I am he, and that I do nothinge of my self: but as my father hath taught me, euen so I speake.","29":"And he that sent me, is with me. The father leaueth me not alone, for I do alwaie that pleaseth him.","30":"Whan he thus spake, many beleued on him. Then sayde Iesus vnto the Iewes, that beleued on him:","31":"Yf ye contynue in my worde, then are ye my very disciples,","32":"and ye shall knowe the trueth, and the trueth shal make you fre.","33":"Then answered they him: We are Abrahams sede, we were neuer bonde to eny man, how sayest thou then: Ye shal be fre?","34":"Iesus answered them, and sayde: Verely verely I saye vnto you: Who so euer doth synne,","35":"is the seruaunt of synne: As for the seruaunt, he abydeth not in the house for euer,","36":"but the sonne abydeth euer. Yf the sonne therfore make you fre, then are ye fre in dede.","37":"I knowe that ye are Abrahams sede, but ye seke to kyll me. For my worde taketh not amonge you.","38":"I speake that I haue sene of my father, & ye do that ye haue sene of youre father.","39":"They answered, and sayde vnto him: Abraham is oure father. Iesus sayde vnto them: Yf ye were Abrahams children, ye wolde do the dedes of Abraham.","40":"But now ye go aboute to kyll me, a man, that haue tolde you the trueth, which I haue herde of God, this dyd not Abraham.","41":"Ye do the dedes of youre father. Then sayde they vnto him: We are not borne of fornicacion, we haue one father, euen God.","42":"Iesus sayde vnto them: Yf God were youre father, then wolde ye loue me. For I am proceaded forth, and come from God. For I am not come of my self, but he hath sent me.","43":"Why knowe ye not the my speach? Eue because ye can not abyde the hearinge of my worde.","44":"Ye are of the father the deuell, and after the lustes of youre father wyl ye do. The same was a murthurer from the begynnynge, and abode not in the trueth: for the trueth is not in him. Whan he speaketh a lye, then speaketh he of his awne: for he is a lyar, and a father of the same.","45":"But because I saye the trueth, ye beleue me not.","46":"Which of you can rebuke me of one synne? Yf I saye the trueth, why do ye not beleue me?","47":"He that is of God, heareth Gods worde. Therfore heare ye not, because ye are not of God.","48":"Then answered the Iewes, and sayde vnto him: Saye we not right, that thou art a Samaritane, and hast the deuell?","49":"Iesus answered: I haue no deuell, but I honoure my father, and ye haue dishonoured me.","50":"I seke not myne awne prayse, but there is one that seketh it, and iudgeth.","51":"Verely verely I saye vnto you: Yf eny man kepe my worde, he shal neuer se death.","52":"Then sayde the Iewes vnto him: Now knowe me, that thou hast the deuell. Abraham is deed and the prophetes, and thou sayest: Yf eny ma kepe my worde, he shal neuer taist of death.","53":"Art thou greater then oure father Abraham? which is deed, and the prophetes are deed? Who makest thou thy self?","54":"Iesus answered: Yf I prayse myself, then is my prayse nothinge. But it is my father that prayseth me, which ye saye is youre God,","55":"and ye knowe hi not: but I knowe him. And yf I shulde saye, I knowe him not, I shulde be a lyar, like vnto you. But I knowe him, and kepe his worde.","56":"Abraham youre father was glad, that he shulde se my daye, And he sawe it, and reioysed.","57":"Then sayde the Iewes vnto him: Thou art not yet fiftie yeare olde, and hast thou sene Abraham?","58":"Iesus sayde vnto the: Verely verely I saye vnto you: Or euer Abraham was, I am.","59":"Then toke they vp stones, to cast at him. But Iesus hyd himself, and wente out of the temple."}
