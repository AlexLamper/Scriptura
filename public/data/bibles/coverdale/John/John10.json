{"1":"Verely verely I saye vnto you: He yt entreth not in at the dore in to the shepefolde, but clymmeth vp some other waye, the same is a thefe & a murthurer.","2":"But he that goeth in at the dore, is the shepherde of the shepe:","3":"to him ye porter openeth, and the shepe heare his voyce, and he calleth his awne shepe by name, and ledeth them out.","4":"And whan he hath sent forth his awne shepe, he goeth before them, and the shepe folowe him: for they knowe his voyce.","5":"As for a straunger, they folowe him not, but flye from him: for they knowe not the voyce of straungers.","6":"This prouerbe spake Iesus vnto them, but they vnderstode not what it was, that he sayde vnto them.","7":"Then sayde Iesus vnto them agayne: Verely verely I saye vnto you: I am the dore of the shepe.","8":"All they that are come before me, are theues and murthures. But ye shepe harkened not vnto them.","9":"I am the dore. Yf eny man entre in by me, he shalbe saued, and shal go in and out, and fynde pasture,","10":"A thefe cometh not, but for to steale, kyll, and destroye. I am come, yt they might haue life, and haue it more abundauntly.","11":"I am a good shepherde. A good shepherde geueth his life for the shepe.","12":"But an hyred seruaunt, which is not the shepherde, nether the shepe are his awne, seyth ye wolfe comynge, and leaueth ye shepe, and flyeth. And the wolfe catcheth & scatereth ye shepe.","13":"But the hyred seruaut flyeth, because he is an hyred seruaunte, and careth not for the shepe.","14":"I am a good sheperde, and knowe myne, and am knowne of myne.","15":"Eue as my father knoweth me, and I knowe ye father.
