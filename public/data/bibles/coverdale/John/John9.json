{"1":"And Iesus passed by, and sawe a man that was borne blynde.","2":"And his disciples axed him, & sayde: Master, Who hath synned? this, or his elders, that he was borne blynde?","3":"Iesus answered: Nether hath this synned, ner his elders, but that ye workes of God shulde be shewed on him.","4":"I must worke the workes of him that hath sent me, whyle it is daye. The night commeth, whan no man can worke.","5":"As longe as I am in the worlde, I am the light of the worlde.","6":"Whan he had thus sayde, he spat on the grounde, and made claye of the spetle, and rubbed the claye on the eyes of the blynde,","7":"and sayde vnto him: Go thy waye to the pole of Syloha (which is interpretated, sent) and wash the. Then wete he his waye and wasshed him, and came seynge.","8":"The neghbours and they that had sene him before, that he was a begger, sayde: Is not this he that sat, and begged?","9":"Some sayde: It is he. Other sayde: he is like him. But he himself sayde: I am euen he.","10":"Then sayde they vnto him: How are thine eyes opened?","11":"He answered, and sayde: The ma that is called Iesus, made claye, and anoynted myne eyes, and sayde: Go thy waye to the pole of Siloha, and wash the. I wente my waye, & washed me, and receaued my sight.","12":"Then sayde they vnto him: Where is he? He sayde: I can not tell.","13":"Then brought they vnto the pharises, him that a litle before was blynde","14":"It was the Sabbath, whan Iesus made the claye, and opened his eyes.","15":"Then agayne the Pharises also axed him, how he had receaued his sight. He sayde vnto the: He put claye vpon myne eyes, and I wasshed me, & now I se.","16":"Then sayde some of the pharises: This man is not of God, seynge he kepeth not ye Sabbath. But the other sayde: How can a synfull man do soch tokens? And there was a stryfe amonge the.","17":"They sayde agayne vnto ye blynde: What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He sayde: he is a prophet.","18":"The Iewes beleued not hi, that he was blynde, and had receaued his sight, tyll they called the elders of him, that had receaued his sight,","19":"and they axed them, and sayde: Is this youre sonne, whom ye saye, was borne blynde? How doth he now se then?","20":"His elders answered them, and sayde: We knowe, that this is oure sonne, and that he was borne blynde.","21":"But how he now seyeth, we can not tell: or who hath opened his eyes, can we not tell. He is olde ynough himself, axe him, let him speake for him self.","22":"This sayde his elders, because they feared the Iewes. For the Iewes had conspyred allready, that yf eny man dyd confesse that he was Christ, the same shulde be excomunicate.","23":"Therfore sayde his elders: He is olde ynough, axe him.","24":"Then called they the ma agayne yt was blynde, and sayde vnto him: Geue God ye prayse, we knowe that this man is a synner.","25":"He answered, & sayde: Whether he be a synner or no, I can not tell: one thinge am I sure off, that I was blynde, and now I se.","26":"The sayde they vnto him agayne: What dyd he vnto the? How opened he thine eyes?","27":"He answered them: I tolde you right now. Herde ye it not? What, wil ye heare it agayne? Will ye also be his disciples?","28":"Then rayted they him, and sayde: Thou art his disciple.","29":"We are sure that God spake wt Moses: As for this felowe, we know not whece he is.","30":"The man answered, and sayde vnto the: This is a maruelous thinge, that ye wote not whence he is, and he hath opened mine eyes.","31":"For we knowe that God heareth not ye sinners: but yf eny ma be a fearer of God, and doth his will, him heareth he.","32":"Sens ye worlde beganne was it not herde, that eny man opened the eyes of one that was borne blynde.","33":"Yf this man were not of God, he coulde haue done nothinge.","34":"They answered, and sayde vnto him: Thou art alltogether borne in synne, and teachest thou vs? And they thrust him out.","35":"Iesus herde, yt they had thrust him out, and wha he had founde him, he sayde vnto him: Beleuest thou on the sonne of God?","36":"He answered, and sayde: LORDE, who is it, yt I might beleue on him?","37":"Iesus sayde vnto him: Thou hast sene him, and he it is, that talketh with the.","38":"He sayde: LORDE, I beleue. And he worshipped him.","39":"And Iesus sayde: I am come to iudgmet in to this worlde, that they which se not, might se: and that they which se, might be made blynde.","40":"And some of the Pharises yt were with him, herde this, and sayde vnto him: Are we then blynde also?","41":"Iesus sayde vnto the: Yf ye were blynde, ye shulde haue no synne. But now that ye saye, we se, therfore youre sonne remayneth."}
