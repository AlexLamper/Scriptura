They sayde vnto hi: We haue not herde, whether there be an holy goost.","3":"He sayde vnto them: Where with then were ye baptysed? They sayde: With the baptyme of Ihon.","4":"Paul sayde: Ihon baptysed with the baptyme of repentaunce, and spake vnto ye people, that they shulde beleue on him, which shulde come after him, that is, on Iesus, that the same is Christ.","5":"Whan they herde that, they were baptysed in the name of the LORDE Iesu.","6":"And whan Paul layed the hades on the, the holy goost came vpon them, and they spake with tunges, and prophecied.","7":"And all the men were aboute twolue.","8":"He wete in to ye synagoge, and preached boldly thre monethes longe, teachinge, and geuynge them exortacions of the kyngdome of God.","9":"But whan dyuerse waxed herde herted, and beleued not, and spake euell of the waye of the LORDE before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, and disputed daylye in the scole of one called Tyrannus.","10":"And this was done two yeares loge, so that all they which dwelt in Asia, herde the worde of the LORDE Iesu, both Iewes & Grekes.","11":"And God wroughte no small miracles by the handes of Paul,","12":"so that from his body there were broughte napkyns or partlettes vnto the sicke, and the diseases departed from them, and the euell spretes wente out of them.","13":"But certayne of the vagabounde Iewes which were coniurers, vndertoke to name ye name of the LORDE Iesus, ouer those that had euell spretes, and sayde: We charge you by Iesus whom Paul preacheth.","14":"They were seuen sonnes of one Sceua a Iewe the hye prest, which dyd so.","15":"The euell sprete answered, and sayde: Iesus I knowe, and Paul I knowe, but who are ye?","16":"And the ma in who the euell sprete was, ranne vpon them, and ouercame them, and cast them vnder him, so that they fled out of the same house naked and wounded.","17":"This was knowne vnto all the Iewes and Grekes which dwelt at Ephesus, and there fell a feare vpon them all. And ye name of the LORDE Iesus was magnified.","18":"Many of the also that beleued, came and cofessed, and shewed their workes.","19":"But many of them that had vsed curious craftes, broughte the bokes together, and burnte them openly: and they counted the pryce of them, and founde it of money fiftye thousande pens.","20":"So mightely grewe ye worde of the LORDE, and preuayled.","21":"Whan this was done, Paul purposed in sprete to take his iourney thorow Macedonia and Achaia, and to go to Ierusale, and sayde: After that I haue bene there, I must se Rome also.","22":"And he sent into Macedonia two that mynistred vnto him, Timotheus and Erastus.
