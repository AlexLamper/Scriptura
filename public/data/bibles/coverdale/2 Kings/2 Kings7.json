Thus sayeth the LORDE: Tomorow aboute this tyme shal a bu?shel of fyne meel be solde for one Sycle, and two bu?shels of barly for one Sycle vnder the porte of Samaria.","2":"Then a knyghte (vpon whose hande the kynge leaned) answered the ma of God, and sayde: And though the LORDE made wyndowes in heaue, how coulde soch a thinge come to passe? He saide: Beholde, thou shalt se it with thine eyes, & shalt not eate therof.","3":"And there were foure leporous men at ye dore before the porte, and one sayde vnto another: Why tary we here whyle we dye?","4":"Though we thoughte to come into the cite, yet is there derth in ye cite, and there shulde we be fayne to dye. And yf we tary here, we must dye also. Let vs go now, and flye vnto the hoost of the Syrians.
