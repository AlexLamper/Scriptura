And the LORDE herde him, for he consydered the myserie of Israel, how the kynge of Syria oppressed them.","5":"And ye LORDE gaue Israel a sauioure, which broughte them out of the power of the Syrians, so yt the children of Israel dwelt in their tentes, like as afore tyme.","6":"Yet lefte they not from the synnes of the house of Ieroboam, which caused Israel to synne, but walked in them. The groue at Samaria stode styll also.","7":"For of the people of Ioahas there were no mo lefte, but fyftye horsmen, ten charettes, and ten thousande fote men: for the kynge of Syria had destroyed them, and made them as the dust in the barne.","8":"What more there is to saye of Ioahas, and all that he dyd, and his power, beholde, it is wrytten in the Cronicles of the kynges of Israel.","9":"And Ioahas fell on slepe with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, & Ioas his sonne was kinge in his steade.","10":"In the seuen and thirtieth yeare of Ioas kynge of Iuda, was Ioas the sonne of Ioahas kynge ouer Israel at Samaria sixtene yeare.","11":"And he dyd that which was euell in the sighte of the LORDE, and departed not from all the synnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel for to synne, but walked in them.","12":"What more there is to saye of Ioas, and what he dyd, & his power, how he foughte with Amasias kynge of Iuda, beholde, it is wrytten in the Cronicles of the kynges of Israel.","13":"And Ioas fell on slepe with his fathers, and Ieroboam sat vpo his seate.
