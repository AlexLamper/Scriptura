{"1":"Heare ye worde of the LORDE, o ye children of Israel: For the LORDE must punysh the, yt dwel in the londe. And why? There is no faithfulnesse, there is no mercy, there is no knowlege of God in the lode:","2":"but swearinge, lyege, maslaughter, theft and aduoutry haue gotten the ouerhande, & one bloudgiltynesse foloweth another.","3":"Therfore shal the londe be in a miserable case, and all they that dwell therin, shal mourne. The beastes in the felde, the foules in ye ayre, and the fishes in the see shall dye.","4":"Yet is there none, that wil chaste nor reproue another. The prestes which shulde refourme other me, are become like the people.","5":"Therfore stomblest thou in ye daye tyme &, the prophet with the in the night. I wil bringe thy mother to sylence, & why?","6":"my people perish, because they haue no knowlege. Seinge then that thou hast refused vnderstondinge, therfore wil I refuse ye also: so that thou shalt nomore be my prest. And for so moch as thou hast forgotten the lawe of thy God, I wil also forget thy childre.","7":"The more they increased in multitude, the more they synned agaynst me, therfore wil I chaurge their honoure in to shame.","8":"They eate vp the synnes of my people, & corage them in their wickednesse.","9":"Thus the prest is become like the people. Wherfore I will punysh them for their wicked wayes, & rewarde them acordinge to their owne ymaginacions.","10":"They shal eate, & not haue ynough: They haue vsed whordome, therfore shall they not prospere: & why? they haue forsaken the LORDE, & not regarded him.","11":"Whordome, wyne and dronckennesse take the herte awaye.","12":"My people axe councel at their stockes, their staffe must tell them. For an whorish mynde hath disceaued them, so yt they comitte fornicacion agaynst their God.","13":"They make sacrifice vpon the hie mountaynes, & burne their incense vpon the hilles, yee amonge the okes, groues & bu?shes, for there are good shadowes. Therfore yor doughters are become harlottes, and youre spouses haue broke their wedlocke","14":"I wil not punish yor doughters for beinge defyled, & yor brydes that became whores: seinge the fathers themselues haue medled with harlottes, and offered with vnthriftes: but the people that wil not vnderstonde, must be punyshed.","15":"Though thou Israel art disposed to playe ye harlot, yet shuldest not thou haue offended, o Iuda: thou shuldest not haue runne to Galgala, ner haue gone vp to Bethaue, ner haue sworne: the LORDE lyueth.","16":"For Israel is gone backe, like a waton cowe. The LORDE therfore shal make hir fede, as ye labe yt goeth astraye.","17":"And where as Ephraim is become partaker of Idols, wel, let him go.","18":"Their dronckenesse hath put the backe, & brought them to whordome. Their rulers loue rewardes, brynge (saye they,) to their owne shame.","19":"A wynde shall take holde of their fethers, & they shall be cofounded in their offeringes."}
