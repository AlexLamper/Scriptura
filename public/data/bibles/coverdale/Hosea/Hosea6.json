{"1":"In their aduersite they shall seke me, and saye: come, let vs turne agayne to the LORDE: for he hath smytten vs, and he shal heale vs:","2":"He hath wounded vs, & he shal bynde vs vp agayne: after two dayes shal he quycken vs, in the thirde daye he shal rase vs vp, so that we shal lyue in his sight.","3":"Then shal we haue vnderstondinge, & endeuoure oure selues to knowe the LORDE. He shal go forth as the sprynge of the daye, and come vnto vs as the euenynge and mornynge rayne vpon the earth.","4":"O Ephraim, what shal I do vnto the? O Iuda, how shal I intreate the? seynge youre loue is like a mornynge cloude, & like a dew yt goeth early awaye.","5":"Therfore haue I cut downe the prophetes, & letten them be slayne for my wordes sake: so that thy punyshment shal come to light.","6":"For I haue pleasure in louynge kyndnesse, and not in offerynge: Yee in the knowlege of God, more then in burntsacrifice.","7":"But euen like as Adam dyd, so haue they broken my couenaunt, and set me at naught.","8":"Galaad is a cite of wicked doers, of malicious people and bloudshedders.","9":"The multitude of the prestes is like an heape of theues, murtherers & bloudthurstie: for they haue wrought abhominacion.","10":"Horrible thinges haue I sene in the house of Israel, there playeth Ephraim the harlot, and Israel is defyled:","11":"but Iuda shall haue an haruest for himself, when I returne the captiuyte of my people."}
