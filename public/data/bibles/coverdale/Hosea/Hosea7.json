{"1":"When I vndertake to make Israel whole, then the vngraciousnesse of Ephraim and the wickednes of Samaria commeth to light: then go they aboute with lyes. At home, they be theues: and without, they fall to robbynge.","2":"They cosidre not in their hertes, that I remebre all their wickednes. They go aboute wt their owne ynuencios, but I se them wel ynough.","3":"They make the kinge and the princes, to haue pleasure in their wickednes & lyes.","4":"All these burne in aduoutry, as it were an ouen yt the baker heateth, whe he hath lefte kneadinge, till the dowe be leuended.","5":"Euen so goeth it this daye with oure kinges and prynces, for they begynne to be woode droncken thorow wyne: they vse familiarite with soch as disceaue the.","6":"They with the ymaginacion of their herte are like an oue, their slepe is all ye night like the slepe of a baker, in the mornynge is he as hote as the flame of fyre:","7":"they are altogether as hote as an ouen. They haue deuoured their owne iudges, all their kinges are falle: yet is there none of the yt calleth vpon me.","8":"Therfore must Ephraim be mixte amonge ye Heithen. Ephraim is become like a cake, yt no man turneth:","9":"straungers haue deuoured his strength, yet he regardeth it not: he waxeth ful of gray haires, yet wil he not knowe it:","10":"& ye pride of Israel is cast downe before their face, yet wil they not turne to the LORDE their God, ner seke him, for all this.","11":"Ephraim is like a doue, that is begyled, and hath no herte. Now call they vpon the Egipcians, now go they to the Assirians:","12":"but whyle they be goinge here and there, I shal sprede my net ouer them, & drawe them downe as ye foules of the ayre: and acordinge as they haue bene warned, so will I punysh them.","13":"Wo be vnto them, for they haue forsake me. They must be destroyed, for they haue set me at naught. I am he that haue redemed them, and yet they dyssemble wt me.","14":"They call not vpon me with their hartes, but lye youlinge vpon their beddes. Where as they come together, it is but for meate & drincke, and me will they not obeye.","15":"I haue taught them, and defended their arme, yet do they ymagin myschefe agaynst me.","16":"They turne them selues, but not a right, & are become as a broken bowe. Their prynces shalbe slayne wt the swearde, for the malice of their tunges, soch blasphemies haue they lerned in the londe of Egipte."}
