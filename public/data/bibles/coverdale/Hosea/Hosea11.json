{"1":"When Israel was yoge, I loued him: and called my sonne out of the londe of Egipte.","2":"But ye more they were called, the more they wente backe: offerynge vnto Idols, and censynge ymages.","3":"I lerned Ephraim to go, and bare them in myne armes, but they regarded not me, that wolde haue helped them.","4":"I led them with coardes of frendshipe, & with bondes of loue. I was euen he, that layed the yocke vpon their neckes. I gaue them their fodder my self,","5":"yt they shulde not go agayne in to Egipte: And now is Assur their kinge: For they wolde not turne vnto me.","6":"Therfore shal ye swearde begynne in their cities, the stoare that they haue lickened vnto, shall be destroyed and eaten vp: and that because of their owne ymaginacions.","7":"My people hath no lust to turne vnto me, their prophetes laye the yocke vpon the, but they ease them not of their burthen.","8":"What greate thinges haue I geuen the, o Ephraim? how faithfully haue I defended the, o Israel? haue I dealt with the as with Adama? or haue I intreated the like Seboim? No, my hert is otherwise mynded. Yee my mercy is to feruent:","9":"therfore haue I not turned me to destroye Ephraim in my wrothful displeasure. For I am God and no man, I am euen that holy one in the myddest of the, though I came not within the cite.","10":"The LORDE roareth like a lyon, that they maye folowe him: Yee as a lyon roareth he, that they maye be afrayed, like the children of the see:","11":"that they maye be scarred awaye from Egipte, as men scarre byrdes: & frayed awaye (as doues vse to be) from the Assirias londe: and that because I wolde haue them tary at home, saieth the LORDE.","12":"But Ephraim goeth aboute me with lies, and the house of Israel dyssembleth. Only Iuda holdeth him with God, and with the true holy thinges."}
