Of their syluer and golde haue they made them ymages, to bringe them selues to destruccion.","5":"Thy calfe (O Samaria) shalbe taken awaye. for my wrothfull indignacion is gone forth agaynst the. How longe wil it be, or they can be clensed?","6":"For the calfe came from Israel, the worke man made it, therfore can it be no God, but euen to a spyders webbe shal ye calfe of Samaria be turned.","7":"They haue sowne wynde, therfore shal they reepe a storme.
