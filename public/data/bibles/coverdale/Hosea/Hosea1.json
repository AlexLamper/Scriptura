{"1":"This is the worde of the LORDE, that came vnto Oseas the sonne of Beeri, in the dayes of Osias, Ioathan, Achas & Ezechias kinges of Iuda: and in the tyme of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioas kynge of Israel.","2":"First, when the LORDE spake vnto Oseas, he saide vnto him: Go thy waye, take an harlot to thy wife, and get childre by her: for the lode hath comitted greate whordome agaynst the LORDE.","3":"So he wente, and toke Gomer ye doughter of Deblaim: which conceaued, and brought forth a sonne.","4":"And the LORDE sayde vnto him: call his name Iesrael, for I wil shortly auenge the bloude of Iesrael vpon the house of Iehu, and will bringe the kingdome of the house of Israel to an ende.","5":"Then will I breake the bowe of Israel, in the valley of Iesrael.","6":"She conceaued yet agayne, and bare a doughter. And he sayde vnto him: Call hir name Loruhama (that is, not opteyninge mercy) ofr I wil haue no pyte vpon the house of Israel, but forget them, and put them clene out of remembraunce.","7":"Neuerthelesse I wil haue mercy vpon the house of Iuda, & wil saue them, euen thorow the LORDE their God. But I wil not delyuer them thorow eny bow, swearde, batel, horses or horsmen.","8":"Now when she had weened Loruhama, she conceaued agayne, & bare a sonne.","9":"Then sayde he: call his name Lo Ami (that is to saye, not my people.) For why? ye are not my people, therfore will not I be yours.","10":"And though the nombre of the children of Israel be as the sonde of the see, which can nether be measured ner tolde: Yet in the place where it is sayde vnto them, ye be not my people: euen there shall it be thus reported of them: they be ye childre of the lyuynge God.","11":"Then shal the children of Iuda and the childre of Israel be gathered together agayne, & chose them selues one heade, and then departe out of the londe: for greate shalbe the daye of Iesrael."}
