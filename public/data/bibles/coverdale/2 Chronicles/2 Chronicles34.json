And my indignacion shal go forth vpon this cite, and shal not be quenched.","26":"And after this maner shal ye saye vnto the kynge of Iuda, that sent you to axe councell at the LORDE: Thus sayeth ye LORDE God of Israel concernynge the wordes that thou hast herde:","27":"Because thine hert is moued, and because thou hast humbled thy selfe in the sighte of God, whan thou herdest his wordes agaynst this place and the inhabiters therof, and hast submytted thy selfe before me, and rent thy clothes, and wepte before me, therfore haue I herde the, sayeth ye LORDE.","28":"Beholde, I wil gather the vnto thy fathers, and thou shalt be layed in thy graue with peace, so yt thine eyes shal not se all the euell that I wyl brynge ouer this place, and the indwellers therof. And they broughte the kynge worde agayne.","29":"Then sent ye kynge, and caused all the Elders in Iuda and Ierusalem to come together.","30":"And the kynge wente vp in to the house of the LORDE, and all the men of Iuda and inhabiters of Ierusale, the prestes, the Leuites, and all the people both small and greate: and all the wordes in the boke of the couenaunt that was founde in the house of the LORDE, were red in their eares.","31":"And ye kynge stode in his place, and made a couenaunt before the LORDE, that they shulde walke after the LORDE, to kepe his comaundementes, his testimonies, and his statutes with all their hert and with all their soule, to do accordinge vnto all the wordes of the couenaunt that are wrytten in this boke.","32":"And there stode all they that were founde at Ierusalem and in Ben Iamin. And ye inhabiters of Ierusalem dyd acordinge to the couenaunt of God the God of their fathers.","33":"And Iosias put awaye all abhominacions out of all the londes that were the children of Israels, and caused all them that were founde in Israel, to serue the LORDE their God. As longe as Iosias lyued, departed they not from the LORDE the God of their fathers."}
