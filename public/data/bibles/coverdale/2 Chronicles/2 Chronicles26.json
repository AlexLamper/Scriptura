{"1":"Then all the people of Iuda toke Osias, which was syxtene yeare olde, and made him kynge in steade of his father Amasias.","2":"He builded Eloth, & broughte it agayne vnto Iuda, after that the kynge was fallen on slepe with his fathers.","3":"Sixtene yeare olde was Osias whan he was made kinge, and reigned two and fiftie yeare at Ierusale. His mothers name was Iechalia of Ierusalem.","4":"And he did right in the syght of the LORDE, as his father Amasias had done,","5":"and soughte God as longe as Zacharias lyued, which taughte in the visyons of God: and as longe as he sought the LORDE, God made him to prospere.","6":"For he wente forth, and foughte agaynst the Philistynes, and brake downe ye walles of Gath, and the walles of Iabne, and the walles of A?dod, and buylded cities aboute A?dod, & amonge the Philistynes.","7":"For God helped him agaynst the Philistines, against the Arabians, agaynst them of GurBaal, & agaynst the Meunites.","8":"And ye Ammonites gaue Osias presentes, & his name came in to Egipte: for he was exceadinge stronge.","9":"And Osias buylded towres at Ierusalem vpon the cornerporte, and on the valley gate, and on other corners, and made them stronge.","10":"He buylded castels also in the wyldernesse, and dygged many welles: for he had many catell, both in the medewes and in the playnes, hu?bandmen also and wynegardeners on the mountaynes and on Carmel: for he delyted in hu?bandrye.","11":"And Osias had an hoost of men of warre goynge forth to the battaill, which were nobred vnder the hande of Ieiel the scrybe & of Maesa the offycer, vnder the hade of Hanania of the kynges rulers.","12":"And the nombre of the chefe fathers amonge the stronge me of warre, was two thousande and syxe hundreth.","13":"And vnder the hande of the hoost thre hundreth thousande, and seuen thousande and fyue hundreth mete for the battayll, in the strength of an armye to helpe the kinge agaynst the enemies.","14":"And Osias prepared for all the hoost, shyldes, speares, helmettes, brestplates, bowes and slyngstones.","15":"And at Ierusale he made ordinaunce coningly, to be vpon the towres and in the pynnacles, to shute arowes and greate stones. And the fame of him came farre abrode, because he was specially helped, tyll he became mightie.","16":"And whan his power was greate, his hert arose to his awne destruccion: for he trespaced agaynst the LORDE his God, and wente in to the temple of the LORDE, to burne incense vpon the altare of incense.","17":"But Asarias the prest wente after him, and foure score prestes with him, valeaunt men,","18":"and withstode kynge Osias, and saide vnto him: It belongeth not vnto thy offyce (Osias) to burne incense vnto the LORDE, but vnto the prestes belongeth it, euen vnto the children of Aaron, which are halowed to burne incense. Go forth out of the Sanctuary: for thou offendest, and it shall be no worshippe vnto the before God the LORDE.","19":"And Osias was wroth, and had a censoure in his hande. And whyle he murmured with the prestes, the leprosy spronge out of his foreheade in the presence of the prestes in the house of the LORDE before the altare of incense.","20":"And Asarias the chefe prest turned his heade towarde him, and so dyd all the prestes, and beholde, he was leper in his foreheade. And they put him out from thence. Yee he made haist himselfe to go forth, for his plage came of the LORDE.","21":"Thus became Osias ye kynge a leper vnto his death, and dwelt full of leprosye in a fre house: for he was put out of the house of the LORDE. But Ioram his sonne had the ouersight of the kynges house, and iudged the people in the londe.","22":"What more there is to saie of Osias (both first and last) Esay the sonne of Amos hath wrytten it.","23":"And Osias fell on slepe wt his fathers, and they buryed him with his fathers in the pece of grounde beside ye kynges sepulcres: for they sayde: He is leporous. And Iotham his sonne was kynge in his steade."}
