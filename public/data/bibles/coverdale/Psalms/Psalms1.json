{"1":"O blessed is ye man, yt goeth not in the councell of ye vngodly: yt abydeth not in the waye off synners, & sytteth not in ye seate of the scornefull.","2":"But delyteth in the lawe of ye LORDE, & exercyseth himself in his lawe both daye and night.","3":"Soch a ma is like a tre plated by ye watersyde, yt brigeth forth his frute in due season. His leeues shal not fall off, ad loke what soeuer he doth, it shal prospere.","4":"As for the vngodly, it is not so with them: but they are like the dust, which ye wynde scatereth awaye from of the grounde.","5":"Therfore the vngodly shall not be able to stonde in the iudgmet, nether the synners in the congregacion off the rightuous.","6":"For the LORDE aloweth ye waye of the rightuous, but the waye of the vngodly shal perishe."}
