{"1":"I cried vnto God with my voyce, yee euen vnto God cried I with my voyce, & he herde me.","2":"In the tyme of my trouble I sought the LORDE, I helde vp my hondes vnto him in the night season, for my soule refused all other comforte.","3":"When I was in heuynesse, I thought vpo God: whe my hert was vexed, then dyd I speake.","4":"Sela. Thou heldest myne eyes wakynge, I was so feble, that I coude not speake,","5":"Then remembred I the tymes of olde, & the yeares that were past.","6":"I called to remembraunce my songe in the night, I commoned with myne owne herte, and sought out my sprete.","7":"Wil the LORDE cast out for euer? Wil he be nomore intreated?","8":"Is his mercy cleane gone? Is his promyse come vtterly to an ende for euermore?","9":"Hath the LORDE forgotten to be gracious? Or, hath he shut vp his louynge kyndnesse in displeasure?","10":"Sela. At the last I came to this poynte, that I thought: O why art thou so foolish? the right honde of the most hyest can chaunge all.","11":"Therfore wil I remembre the workes of the LORDE, and call to mynde thy wonders of olde tyme.","12":"I wil speake of all thy workes, and my talkynge shalbe of thy doinges.","13":"Thy waye (o God) is holy, who is so greate & mightie as God?","14":"Thou art the God, that doth wonders, thou hast declared thy power amonge the people.","15":"Thou with thine arme hast delyuered thy people, euen the sonnes of Iacob and Ioseph.","16":"Sela. The waters sawe ye (o God) ye waters sawe ye, & were afrayed: ye depthes were moued.","17":"The thicke cloudes poured out water, ye cloudes thodered, and thy arowes wente abrode.","18":"Thy thonder was herde rounde aboute, the lighteninges shone vpon the grounde, the earth was moued and shoke withall.","19":"Thy waye was in the see, and thy pathes in the greate waters, yet coude no man knowe thy fotesteppes.","20":"Thou leddest thy people like a flocke of shepe, by the honde of Moses and Aaron."}
