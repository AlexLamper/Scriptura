Or, who shal remayne in his holy place?","4":"Eue he yt hath innocet hodes & a clene herte: which lifteth not vp his mynde vnto vanite, & sweareth not to disceaue.","5":"He shal receaue the blessinge fro the LORDE, ad mercy fro God his sauioure.","6":"This is ye generacio of the yt seke him, of the yt seke yi face, o Iacob.","7":"Sela. Open yor gates (o ye prices) let the euerlastinge dores be opened, yt ye kynge of glory maye come in.","8":"Who is this kynge of glory? It is the LORDE stroge and mightie, euen the LORDE mightie in batell.","9":"Open youre gates (o ye prynces) let the euerlastinge dores be opened, yt the kynge off glory maye come in.","10":"Who is this kynge off glory? It is the LORDE of hoostes, he is the kynge of glory. Sela."}
