{"1":"The very heaues declare the glory off God, ad the very firmamet sheweth his hadye worke.","2":"One daye telleth another, and one night certifieth another.","3":"There is nether speach ner laguage, but their voyces are herde amoge the.","4":"Their soude is gone out in to all londes, and their wordes in to the endes of the worlde.","5":"In the hath he sett a tabernacle for ye Sone, which cometh forth as a brydegrome out of his chambre, & reioyseth as a giaunte to rune his course.","6":"It goeth forth fro the one ende of the heauen, and runneth aboute vnto the same ende agayne, & there maye no ma hyde himself fro the heate therof.","7":"The lawe of the LORDE is a perfecte lawe, it quickeneth the soule. The testimony of ye LORDE is true, & geueth wisdome euen vnto babes.","8":"The statutes of the LORDE are right, & reioyse the herte: ye comaundemet of ye LORDE is pure, and geueth light vnto the eyes.","9":"The feare of the LORDE is cleane, & endureth for euer: the iudgmentes of the LORDE are true and rigtuous alltogether.","10":"More pleasunt are they then golde, yee then moch fyne golde: sweter then hony & the hony combe.","11":"These thy seruaunt kepeth, & for kepinge of them there is greate rewarde.","12":"Who can tell, how oft he offendeth? Oh clese thou me fro my secrete fautes.","13":"Kepe thy seruaute also from presumptuous synnes, lest they get the dominion ouer me: so shal I be vndefyled & innocet fro the greate offence.","14":"Yee the wordes of my mouth & the meditacio of my herte shalbe acceptable vnto the, o LORDE, my helper and my redemer."}
