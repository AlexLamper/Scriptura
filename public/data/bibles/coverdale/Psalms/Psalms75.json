{"1":"Unto the (o God) will we geue thakes, yee vnto the wyll we geue thankes,","2":"& seynge thy name is so nye, we will tell of thy wonderous workes.","3":"When I maye get a conuenient tyme, I shal iudge acordinge vnto right.","4":"The earth is weake & all that is therin, but I beare vp hir pilers.","5":"Sela. I sayde vnto the madde people: deale not so madly, & to the vngodly: set not vp youre hornes.","6":"Set not vp youre hornes an hye, & speake not with a stiff necke.","7":"For promocio commeth nether from the east ner from the west, ner yet fro the wyldernesse.","8":"And why? God is the iudge: he putteth downe one & setteth vp another.","9":"For in the honde of the LORDE there is a cuppe full of stronge wyne, & he poureth out of the same: As for the dregges therof, all ye vngodly of the earth shal drynke them, & sucke them out.","10":"But I wil talke of the God of Iacob, & prayse him for euer. All the hornes of the vngodly will I breake, & ye hornes of the rightuous shalbe exalted."}
