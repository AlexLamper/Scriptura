{"1":"The foolish bodies saye in their hertes: Tush, there is no God. Corrupte are they, and become abhominable in their wickednesses: there is not one, that doth good.","2":"God loked downe from heauen vpo the children of men, to se yf there were eny that wolde vnderstonde, or seke after God.","3":"But they are all gone out of ye waye, they are all become vnprofitable: there is none yt doth good, no not one.","4":"How ca they haue vnderstondinge, that are the workers of wickednes, eatinge vp my people as it were bred, & call not vpon God?","5":"They are afrayed, where no feare is: for God breaketh the bones of them that besege the: thou puttest them to confucion, for God despiseth them.","6":"Oh yt the sauynge health were geuen vnto Israel out of Sion: Oh that the LORDE wolde delyuer his people out of captiuyte. Then shulde Iacob reioyse, & Israel shulde be right glad."}
