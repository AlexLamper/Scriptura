{"1":"The foolish bodyes saye in their hertes: Tush, there is no God. They are corrupte, ad become abhominable in their doynges, there is not one yt doth good.","2":"The LORDE loked downe fro heaue vpo the children of men, to se yf there were eny, that wolde vnderstonde & seke after God. But they are all gone out of the waye, they are alltogether become vnprofitable: there is none that doth good, no not one.","3":"Their throte is an open sepulcre, with their tonges they haue disceaued, the poyson of Aspes is vnder their lippes.","4":"Their mouth is full of cursinge and bytternes, their fete are swift to shed bloude. Destruccion & wretchednes are in their wayes, ad the waye of peace haue they not knowne: there is no feare off God before their eyes.","5":"How can they haue vnderstondinge, yt worke myschefe, eatinge vp my people, as it were bred, & call not vpo ye LORDE?","6":"Therfore shal they be brought in greate feare, for God stondeth by the generacion of the rightuous.","7":"As for you, ye haue made a mocke at the coucell of the poore, because he putteth his trust in the LORDE. Oh yt the sauynge health were geuen vnto Israel out off Sion. Oh that the LORDE wolde delyuer his people out of captiuyte. The shulde Iacob reioyse, and Israel shulde be right glad."}
