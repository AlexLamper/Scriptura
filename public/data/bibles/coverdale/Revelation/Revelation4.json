And vpon the seates xxiiij. elders syttinge clothed in whyte rayment, and had on their heades crownes of golde.","5":"And out of ye seate proceded lightnynges, and thundrynges, & voyces, and there wer seuen lapes of fyre, burninge before the seate, which are the seuen spretes of God.","6":"And before the seate there was a see of glasse like vnto crystall, and in the mydes off the seate, and rounde aboute the seate, were foure beastes full of eyes before and behynde.","7":"And the first beest was like a lion, the seconde beest like a calfe, and the thyrde beest had a face as a man and the fourth beest was like a flyenge egle.","8":"And the foure beestes had eche one off them vj. wynges aboute him, and they were full of eyes with in.
