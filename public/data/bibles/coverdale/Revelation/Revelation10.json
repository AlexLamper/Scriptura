{"1":"And I sawe another mightye angell come doune fro heauen, clothed with a cloude, and the rayne bowe vpon his heed. And his face as it were ye Sonne, and his fete as it were pyllars of fyre:","2":"and he had in his honde a lytell boke opyn: and he put his right fote vpon ye see, and his lifte fote on ye earth.","3":"And cryed with a lowde voyce, as when a lyon roreth. And when he had cryed, seue thondres spake their voyces.","4":"And when the seue thodres had spoke their voyces, I was aboute to wryte. And I herde a voyce from heauen sayenge vnto me: seale vp those thinges which the seuen thondres spake, and wryte them not.","5":"And the angel which I sawe stonde vpo the see, and vpon the earth, lifte vppe his honde to heauen,","6":"and swore by him that liueth for euermore, which created heauen, and the thinges that there in are, and ye see, and the thinges which are therin: that there shalbe nomore tyme:","7":"but in the dayes of the voyce of the seueth angel, when he shal begynne to blowe, the mistery of God shalbe fynisshed, as he preached by his seruauntes the prophetes.","8":"And the voyce which I herde from heaue, spake vnto me agayne, and sayde: go and take the lytle boke which is open in the honde of the angel, which stondeth vpo the see, and vpon the earth.","9":"And I went vnto the angel, and sayde vnto him: geue me the lytle boke. And he sayde vnto me: Take it, and eate it vp, and it shal make thy belly bytter, but it shalbe in thy mouth as swete as hony.","10":"And I toke the lytle boke out of his honde, and ate it vp, and it was in my mouth as swete as hony, and as sone as I had eaten it, my belly was bytter.","11":"And he sayde vnto me: thou muste prophesy agayne vnto the people, and to the Heythen, and tonges, and to many kynges."}
