{"1":"And there cam one of the seue angels, which had the seuen vialles, and talked with me, sayenge vnto me: Come, I wil shewe the the iugdment of the greate whore, that sytteth vpon many waters,","2":"with whom the kynges of the earth haue commytted whordome, and the inhabiters of the earth are dronken with the wyne of her fornicacion.","3":"And he caryed me awaye into the wildernes in ye sprete. And I sawe a woman syt vpon a rose colored beest, full of names of blasphemie, which had seue heades & ten hornes.","4":"And ye woman was arayed in purple and rose color, and decked with golde, precious stone, and pearles, and had a cupp of golde in her honde, full of abhominacions, and fylthines of her wordome.","5":"And in her forhed was a name wrytte, a mistery; greate Babilon the mother of whordome, and abominacios of the earth.","6":"And I sawe the wyfe dronke with the bloude of sayntes, and with the bloud of the witnesses of Iesu. And when I sawe her, I wondred with greate mervayle.","7":"And the angell sayde vnto me: wherfore meruayllest thou? I wyl shewe the the mistery of the woman, and of the beest that beerith her, which hath seuen heades, and ten hornes.","8":"The beest that thou seest, was, and is not, and shall ascende out of the bottomlesse pytt, and shal go in to perdicion, and they that dwell on the earth shal wondre (whose names are not wrytten in the boke of life from the begynnynge of the worlde) when they beholde the beest that was, and is not.","9":"And here is a mynde, that hath wissdome. The seuen heades are seuen mountanes, on which the woman sytteth:","10":"they are also seuen kynges. Fyue are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come. When he commeth, he muste continue a space.","11":"And the beest that was, and is not, is eue the eyght, and is of the seuen, and shal go in to destruccion.","12":"And ye ten hornes which thou sawest, are ten kynges, which haue not yet receaued the kyngdome, but shal receaue power as kynges at one houre with ye beest.","13":"These haue one mynde, and shal geue their power and stregth vnto ye beeste.","14":"These shal fyght with the lambe, and the labe shal ouercome them: For he is LORDE of all lordes, and kinge of all kinges: and they that are on his syde, are called, and chosen and faithfull.","15":"And he saide vnto me: The waters which thou sawest, where ye whore sytteth, are people, and folke, and nacions, and tonges.","16":"And the ten hornes, which thou sawest vpon the beest, are they that shal hate the whore, and shal make her desolate, and naked, and shall eate hir flesshe, and burne her with fyre.","17":"For God hath put in their hertes, to fulfill his wyll, and to do with one consent, for to geue hir kyngdome vnto the beest, vntill the wordes of God be fulfylled.","18":"And the woma which thou sawest, is that greate cite, which raigneth ouer the kynges of the earth."}
