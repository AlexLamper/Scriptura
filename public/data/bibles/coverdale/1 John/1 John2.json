{"1":"My litle children, these thinges wryte I vnto you, that ye shulde not synne: and yf eny man synne, we haue an aduocate with the father, euen Iesus Christ which is righteous:","2":"and he it is that optayneth grace for oure synnes: not for oure synnes onely, but also for the synnes of all the worlde.","3":"And hereby are we sure that we knowe him, yf we kepe his comaundemetes.","4":"He that sayeth: I knowe him, and kepeth not his comaundemetes, is a lyar, and the trueth is not in him,","5":"But who so kepeth his worde, in him is the loue of God perfecte in dede. Hereby knowe we, that we are in him.","6":"He yt sayeth he abydeth in him, oughte to walke euen as he walked.","7":"Brethren, I wryte no new commaundement vnto you, but that olde commaundement, which ye haue herde from the begynnynge.","8":"The olde comaundement is the worde, which ye haue herde from the begynnynge. Agayne, a new comaundemet wryte I vnto you, a thinge that is true in him & also in you: for the darknesse is past, and the true lighte now shyneth.","9":"He that sayeth he is in lighte, and hateth his brother, is yet in darknesse.","10":"He yt loueth his brother, abydeth in the lighte, and there is none occasion of euell in him.","11":"But he yt hateth his brother, is in darknes, and walketh in darknes, and can not tell whither he goeth, for ye darknes hath blynded his eyes.","12":"Babes, I wryte vnto you, that yor synnes are forgeuen you for his names sake.","13":"I wryte vnto you fathers, how that ye haue knowne him which is from ye begynnynge. I wryte vnto you yonge me, how that ye haue euercome the wicked. I wryte vnto you litle children, how that ye haue knowne the father.","14":"I haue wrytten vnto you fathers, how that ye haue knowne him, which is fro the begynnynge. I haue wrytten vnto you yonge men, how that ye are stronge, and the worde of God abydeth in you, and ye haue ouercome that wicked.","15":"Se that ye loue not the worlde, nether ye thinges that are in the worlde. Yf eny man loue the worlde, the loue of the father is not in him:","16":"for all that is in the worlde (namely the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pryde of life) is not of the father, but of the worlde.","17":"And the worlde passeth awaye and the lust therof. But he that fulfylleth the wyll of God, abydeth for euer.","18":"Litle children, it is the last houre, and (as ye haue herde that Antechrist shal come) euen now are there many become Antechristes allready: wherby we knowe, that it is ye last houre.","19":"They wente out fro vs, but they were not of vs: for yf they had bene of vs, they wolde no doute haue contynued with vs. But that they maye be knowne, how that they are not all of vs.","20":"But ye haue the anoyntinge of him yt is holy, & ye knowe all thiges.","21":"I haue not wrytte vnto you, as though ye knewe not ye trueth but ye knowe it, & are sure, yt no lye cometh of ye trueth.","22":"Who is a lyar, but he yt denyeth yt Iesus is Christ? The same is ye Antichrist, yt denyeth the father & ye sonne.","23":"Whosoeuer denyeth the sonne, the same hath not the father.","24":"Loke what ye haue herde now from ye begynnynge, let the same abyde in you. Yf yt which he herde from the begynnynge shal remayne in you, then shal ye also abyde in ye sonne and in the father.","25":"And this is the promes yt he hath promysed vs, eue eternall life.","26":"This haue I wrytte vnto you cocerninge the that disceaue you.","27":"And the anoyntinge which ye haue receaued of him, dwelleth in you: & ye nede not yt eny ma teach you, but as the anoyntinge teacheth you all thiges, euen so is it true, & is no lye. And as it hath taughte you, eue so abide ye therin.","28":"And now babes, abyde in hi, yt wha he shal appeare, we maye be bolde, & not be made ashamed of him at his commynge.","29":"Yf ye knowe yt he is righteous, knowe also that he which doth righteousnes, is borne of him."}
