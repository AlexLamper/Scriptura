{"1":"Beholde what loue the father hath shewed on vs, yt we shulde be called the childre of God. Therfore ye worlde knoweth you not, because it knoweth not him.","2":"Dearly beloued, we are now ye childre of God, and yet hath it not appeared what we shalbe. But we knowe yt when he shal appeare, we shal be like him: for we shal se him as he is.","3":"And euery man yt hath this hope in him, pourgeth him selfe, euen as he is pure.","4":"Who so euer comytteth synne, comytteth vnrighteousnes also, and synne is vnrighteousnes.","5":"And ye knowe that he appeared to take awaye oure synnes: and in him is no synne.","6":"Who so euer abydeth in him, synneth not: who soeuer synneth, hath not sene him nether knowne him.","7":"Babes, let noman disceaue you. He that doeth righteousnes, is righteous, euen as he is righteous.","8":"He that commytteth synne, is of the deuell: for the deuell synneth sence ye begynnynge. For this purpose appeared the sonne of God, to lowse the workes of the deuell.","9":"Who so euer is borne of God, synneth not: for his sede remayneth in him, & he ca not synne, because he is borne of God.","10":"By this are the children of God knowne & the children of the deuell. Who so euer doeth not righteousnes, is not of God, nether he thath loueth not his brother.","11":"For this is the tydinges which ye haue herde from the begynnynge, that ye shulde loue one another,","12":"not as Cain, which was of the wicked, and slewe his brother. And wherfore slewe he him? euen because his awne workes were euell, and his brothers righteous.","13":"Maruayle not (my brethren) though the worlde hate you.","14":"We knowe yt we are traslated from death vnto life, because we loue the brethren. He that loueth not his brother, abydeth in death.","15":"Who soeuer hateth his brother, is a mansleyer. And ye knowe that a mansleyer hath not eternall life abydinge in him.","16":"Hereby haue we perceaued loue, that he gaue his life for vs, and therfore ought we also to geue oure lyues for the brethre.","17":"But he yt hath this worldes good, & seyth his brother haue nede, and shutteth vp his hert fro him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?","18":"My litle children, let vs not loue with worde nether with tonge, but with ye dede, and with the trueth.","19":"Hereby knowe we, that we are of the verite, and can quyete oure hertes before him.","20":"But yf oure hert condemne vs, God is greater the oure hert, and knoweth all thinges.","21":"Dearly beloued, yf oure hert condemne vs not, then haue we a fre boldnes to God warde.","22":"And what so euer we axe, we shal receaue it: because we kepe his comaundemetes, and do those thinges, which are pleasaunt in his sighte.","23":"And this is his comaundement, that we beleue on ye name of his sonne Iesus Christ, and loue one another, as he gaue commaundement.","24":"And he that kepeth his commaundementes, dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby knowe we that he abydeth in vs, euen by the sprete which he hath geuen vs."}
