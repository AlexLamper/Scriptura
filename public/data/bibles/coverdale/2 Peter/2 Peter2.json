{"1":"Bvt there were false prophetes also amonge the people, euen as there shalbe false teachers amonge you likewyse, which preuely shal brynge in damnable sectes, euen denyenge the LORDE that hath boughte them, and shal brynge vpon them selues swift damnacion:","2":"and many shal folowe their damnable wayes, by who the waye of the trueth shal be euell spoke of:","3":"and thorow cuvetousnes shal they with fayned wordes make marchaundise of you, vpo who the iudgment is not necliget in tarienge of olde, and their damnacion slepeth not.","4":"For yf God spared not the angels that synned, but cast them downe with the cheynes of darknes in to hell, and delyuered the ouer to be kepte vnto iudgment:","5":"Nether spared the olde worlde, but saued Noe the preacher of righteousnes himselfe beynge ye eight, and brought the floude vpo the worlde of the vngodly:","6":"And turned the cities of Sodom and Gomor into asshes, ouerthrue them, damned them, and made on them an ensample, vnto those that after shulde lyue vngodly:","7":"And delyuered iust Loth which was vexed with the vngodly conuersacion of ye wicked.","8":"For in so moch as he was righteous and dwelt amonge them, so that he must nedes se it and heare it, his righteous soule was greued from to daye to daye with their vnlaufull dedes.","9":"The LORDE knoweth how to delyuer the godly out of tentacion, and how to reserue the vniust vnto the daye of iudgment for to be punyshed:","10":"but specially them that walke after the flesh in ye lust of vnclennes, and despyse the rulers: beynge presumptuous, stubborne, and feare not to speake euell of the yt are in auctorite","11":"wha the angels yet which are greater both in power and might, beare not that blasphemous iudgment agaynst them of the LORDE.","12":"But these are as ye brute beestes, which naturally are broughte forth to be take and destroyed: speakynge euell of yt they knowe not, and shal perishe in their owne destruccion,","13":"and so receaue ye rewarde of vnrighteousnes.They counte it pleasure to lyue deliciously for a season: Spottes are they and fylthynes: lyuynge at pleasure and in disceaueable wayes: feastynge wt that which is youres,","14":"hauynge eyes full of aduoutrye, and ca not ceasse from synne, entysinge vnstable soules: hauynge an hert exercysed wt couetousnes: they are cursed children,","15":"and haue forsaken the righte waye, and are gone astraye: folowinge the waye of Balaam the sonne of Bosor, which loued the rewarde of vnrighteousnes:","16":"but was rebuked of his iniquyte.
