Ye shal go forth, & multiplie as ye fat calues.","3":"Ye shal treade downe ye vngodly: for they shalbe like the asshes vnder the soles of youre fete, in the daye yt I shal make, sayeth the LORDE of hoostes.","4":"Remembre the lawe of Moses my seruaunt, which I committed vnto him in Oreb for all Israel, with the statutes and ordinaunces.","5":"Beholde, I will sende you Elias ye prophet: before the comynge off the daye of the great and fearfull LORDE.","6":"He shall turne the hertes of the fathers to their children and the hertes of the children to their fathers, that I come not, and smyte the earth with cursynge."}
