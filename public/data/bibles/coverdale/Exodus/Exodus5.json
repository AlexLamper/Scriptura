Get you hece to yor laboure.","5":"Pharao saide morouer: Beholde, ye people are to many in ye lande, and yet wil ye byd them ceasse from their laboure.","6":"The same daye therfore dyd Pharao comaunde the workmasters of the people, and their officers, and sayde:","7":"Ye shal not gather and geue the people eny more strawe, to burne bryck, as yesterdaye and yeryesterdaye. Let them go, and gather them strawe them selues.","8":"And the nombre of the brycke which they made yesterdaye & yeryesterdaye, shall ye laye vpon them neuertheles, and mynish nothinge therof: for they are ydle. Therfore crye they and saye: We wil go, and do sacrifice vnto oure God.","9":"Let the men be kepte downe wt laboure, yt they maye haue to do, & not to turne them selues to false wordes.","10":"Then wente the workmasters of the people & their officers out, & spake vnto the people: Thus sayeth Pharao: There shall no strawe be geuen you,","11":"go youre waye youre selues, and get you strawe, where ye can fynde it. But of youre labor there shall nothinge be mynished.","12":"Then were the people scatred in all ye lande of Egipte, to gather stubble, that they might haue strawe.","13":"And the workmasters haistied them forwarde, & sayde: Fulfill yor daye worke, like as whan ye had strawe.","14":"And the officers of ye children of Israel, whom Pharaos worckmasters had set ouer them, were beaten, & it was saide vnto them: Wherfore haue ye not fulfilled yor appoynted daye worke to daye and yesterdaye, like as in tymes past?","15":"Than wente the officers of the children of Israel, & coplayned vnto Pharao: Wherfore wilt thou deale thus wt thy seruauntes?","16":"Thy seruauntes haue no strawe geuen the, & yet must we make the brycke that are appoynted vs. And beholde, thy seruauntes are beaten, & thy people are euell intreated.","17":"Pharao sayde: Ye are ydle, ydle are ye, therfore saye ye: we will go, and do sacrifice vnto the LORDE.","18":"Go now yor waye therfore, & worke: there shall no strawe be geuen you, but the nombre of brycke shal ye delyuer.","19":"Then sawe the officers of the children of Israel, yt it was not amended, for it was sayde: ye shal mynish nothinge of the daye worke of the brycke.","20":"And whan Moses & Aaron wente from Pharao, they came forth to mete them,","21":"& sayde vnto them: The LORDE loke vpon you, & iudge it, for ye haue made the sauoure of vs to stynke before Pharao and his seruauntes, and haue geuen them a swerde in their handes, to slaye vs.","22":"But Moses came agayne vnto the LORDE, and sayde: LORDE, wherfore dealest thou so euell wt this people? Wherfore hast thou sent me?","23":"For sence the tyme that I wente in vnto Pharao, to speake vnto him in thy name, he hath dealt euell with this people, and thou hast not delyuered yi people."}
