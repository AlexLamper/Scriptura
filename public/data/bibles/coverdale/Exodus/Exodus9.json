{"1":"The LORDE sayde vnto Moses: Go in to Pharao, and speake vnto him: Thus sayeth the LORDE God of ye Hebrues: let my people go, yt they maye serue me.","2":"Yf thou wilt not, but holde them longer,","3":"beholde, the hande of the LORDE shalbe vpon thy catell in the felde, vpon horses, vpon Asses, vpon Camels, vpon oxen, vpon shepe with a very sore pestilence.","4":"And ye LORDE shall make a diuysion betwene the catell of the Israelites & the Egipcians, so yt there shal nothinge dye of all that the children of Israel haue.","5":"And ye LORDE appoynted a tyme, and sayde: Tomorow shal the LORDE do this vpon earth.","6":"And the LORDE dyd the same on the morow. And there dyed of all maner of catell of the Egipcians: but of ye catell of ye childre of Israel there dyed not one.","7":"And Pharao sent thither, & beholde, there was not one of the catell of Israel deed. But Pharaos hert was hardened, so yt he let not ye people go.","8":"Then sayde ye LORDE vnto Moses & Aaron: Take youre handes full of asshes out of the fornace, & let Moses sprenkle it towarde heauen before Pharao,","9":"that it maye be dust in all the lande of Egipte, & that there maye be sores & blaynes vpon men & vpon catell in all the lande of Egipte.","10":"And they toke asshes out of ye fornace, & stode before Pharao, & Moses sprenkled it towarde heaue. Then were there sores and blaynes vpon men & vpon catell,","11":"so that the Sorcerers might not stode before Moses by reason of the sores. For there were sores vpo the Sorcerers as well as vpon all the Egipcians.","12":"But the LORDE hardened Pharaos hert, so that he herkened not vnto them, eue as the LORDE had sayde vnto Moses.","13":"Then sayde the LORDE vnto Moses: Get the vp tomorow by tymes, & stonde before Pharao, & speake vnto him: Thus sayeth ye LORDE God of the Hebrues: let my people go, yt they maye serue me,","14":"els wyll I at this tyme sende all my plages in to thine hert, & vpon thy seruautes & vpon thy people: that thou mayest knowe, yt there is none like me in all londes.","15":"For I will now stretch out my hande, & smyte the & thy people wt pestilence, so yt thou shalt be roted out from the earth.","16":"Yet haue I stered ye vp for this cause, euen to shew my power vpon ye, and that my name might be declared in all londes.","17":"Thou holdest my people yet, & wilt not let them go,","18":"beholde, tomorow aboute this tyme wyll I cause a mightie greate hayle to rayne, soch as hath not bene in the londe of Egipte, sence the tyme that it was grouded, hither to.","19":"And now sende thou, & saue thy catell, & all yt thou hast in the felde: for all men & catell that shalbe founde in the felde, & not brought in to the houses, yf the hayle fall vpon them, they shall dye.","20":"Now who so feared the worde of the LORDE amonge Pharaos seruauntes, caused his seruauntes & catell to flye in to the houses:","21":"but loke whose hertes regarded not the worde of ye LORDE, left their seruauntes and catell in the felde.","22":"Then sayde the LORDE vnto Moses: Strech out thy hande towarde heaue, that it maye hayle vpon all the lande of Egipte, vpon men, vpon catell, & vpon all herbes of the felde in the lande of Egipte.","23":"So Moses stretched out his staff towarde heauen, and the LORDE caused it to thonder & hayle, so yt the fyre ranne alonge vpon the earth. Thus the LORDE hayled & rayned vpon the londe of Egipte,","24":"so that the hayle & fyre wente so horrybly together, as neuer was in all the lade of Egipte, sens the tyme that there were people therin.","25":"And the hayle smote the whole lande of Egipte, all that was vpon ye felde, both men & catell, & smote all the herbes vpon the felde, & brake all the trees vpon ye felde,","26":"saue onely in the lande of Gosen, where the childre of Israel were, there it hayled not.","27":"Then sent Pharao & called for Moses & Aaron, & sayde vnto them: Now haue I synned, ye LORDE is righteous, but I & my people are vngodly.","28":"Yet praye ye vnto the LORDE, that the thonder & hayle of God maye ceasse, then wyl I let you go, that ye shal tary here no longer.","29":"Moses sayde vnto him: Whan I am come out of the cite, I wyll stretch out myne handes vnto the LORDE, so shal the thonder ceasse, & there shal be nomore hayle: that thou mayest knowe, that the earth is the LORDES.","30":"But I knowe, yt both thou & thy seruauntes feare not yet the LORDE God.","31":"Thus the flax and the barlye were smytten: for the barlye was shot vp, & ye flax was boulled:","32":"but the wheate and ye rye were not smytten, for they were late sowen.","33":"So Moses wente from Pharao out of ye cite, & stretched out his hades vnto ye LORDE. And ye thoder & the hayle ceassed, & the rayne dropped not vpo the earth.","34":"But wha Pharao sawe yt the rayne & thonder & hayle ceassed, he synned agayne, and herdened his hert, he & his seruauntes.","35":"So Pharaos hert was hardened, yt he let not the childre of Israel go, eue as the LORDE had sayde by Moses."}
