He saide a staff.","3":"He sayde: Cast it from the vpon the grounde. And he cast it fro him: then was it turned to a serpent. And Moses fled fro it.","4":"But ye LORDE saide vnto him: Stretch forth thine hande, & take it by the tayle. Then stretched he forth his hande, and toke it, and it became a staff agayne in his hande.","5":"Therfore shal they beleue that ye LORDE God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac ye God of Iacob hath appeared vnto the.","6":"And the LORDE sayde furthermore vnto him: Thrust thine hade in to yi bosome. And he thrust it in to his bosome, & toke it out: beholde, the was it leper like snowe.","7":"And he saide: Put it in to yi bosome agayne.
