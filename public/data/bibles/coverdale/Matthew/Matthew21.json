{"1":"Now whan they drew nye vnto Ierusalem, and were come to Bethphage vnto mount Oliuete, Iesus sent two of his disciples,","2":"and sayde vnto them: Go in to the towne that lyeth before you, & anone ye shal fynde an Asse bounde, and hir foale with her: lowse them, and brynge the vnto me.","3":"And yf eny man saye ought vnto you, saye ye: the LORDE hath nede of the, And straight waye he wil let them go.","4":"But all this was done, that the thinge might be fulfylled, which was spoken by the prophet, sayenge:","5":"Tell the doughter of Sion: beholde, thy kynge commeth vnto ye meke, syttinge vpon an Asse and a foale of ye Asse vsed to the yocke.","6":"The disciples wente, and dyd as Iesus commaunded them,","7":"and brought the Asse and the foale, & layed their clothes vpon them, and set him theron.","8":"But many of the people spred their garmentes in the waye: other cut downe braunches from the trees, and strawed them in the waye.","9":"As for the people that wente before and that came after, they cryed and sayde: Hosianna vnto the sonne of Dauid, Blessed be he that commeth in the name of the LORDE, Hosianna in the height.","10":"And whan he was come in to Ierusalem, all the cite was moued, and sayde: Who is this?","11":"And the people sayde: This is Iesus ye prophet of Nazareth out of Galile.","12":"And Iesus wente in to the teple of God, and cast out all them that bought and solde in the teple, and ouerthrew the tables of the money chaungers, and the seates of them that solde doues,","13":"and sayde vnto them: It is wrytte: My house shalbe called ye house of prayer, but ye haue made it a denne of murthurers.","14":"The blynde also and ye lame came vnto him in the temple, and he healed them.","15":"But whan the hye prestes and the scrybes sawe the wonders that he dyd, and the children crienge in the temple and sayenge: Hosianna vnto the sonne of Dauid, they disdayned,","16":"and sayde vnto him: Hearest thou what these saye? Iesus sayde vnto them: Yee. Haue ye neuer red: Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklinges thou hast ordeyned prayse?","17":"And he left them there, and wente out of the cite vnto Bethania, and there abode ouer night.","18":"But in the mornynge as he returned in to the cite, he hugred.","19":"And in the waye he sawe a fygge tre, and came vnto it, and founde nothinge theron, but leaues onely, and sayde vnto it: Neuer frute growe on the from hence forth. And immediatly the fygge tre wythred awaye.","20":"And whan his disciples sawe that, they marueyled, and sayde. How is ye fygge tre wythred awaye so soone?","21":"Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: Verely I saye vnto you: Yf ye haue faith & doute not, ye shal not onely do this with the fygge tre, but yf ye shal saye vnto this mountayne: Avoyde, and cast thy self in to the see, it shal be done.","22":"And what soeuer ye axe in prayer, yf ye beleue, ye shal receaue it.","23":"And when he was come in to the teple, the chefe prestes and the elders of the people came vnto him (as he was teachinge) & sayde: By what auctorite doest thou these thinges? and who gaue the this auctorite?","24":"Iesus answered and sayde vnto them: I wil axe a worde of you also: which yf ye tell me, I in like wyse wyl tell you, by what auctorite I do these thinges.","25":"The baptime of Iho, whece was it? from heaue, or of men? Then thought they amoge them selues, and saide: Yf we saye it was from heaue, then shal he saye vnto us: Why dyd ye not then beleue him?","26":"But yf we saye it was of men, the feare we the people: For euery ma helde Ihon for a prophet.","27":"And they answered Iesus, & sayde: We can not tell. Then sayde he vnto them: Nether tell I you, by what auctorite I do these thinges.","28":"But what thinke ye? A certayne man had two sonnes, and came to the first, and sayde: Go thy waye my sonne, & worke to daye in my vynyarde.","29":"He answered and sayde: I wil not, but afterwarde he repented, and wente.","30":"He came also vnto the secode, and sayde likewyse. And he answered and saide: I wil syr. And wete not.","31":"Whether of them twayne dyd the wil of the father? They sayde vnto him: the first. Iesus sayde vnto the: Verely I saye vnto you: The publicans and harlottes shal come in to the kyngdome of God before you.","32":"For Ihon came vnto you, and taught you ye right waye and ye beleued him not: but the publicans & harlottes beleued hi. As for you, though ye sawe it, yet were ye not moued with repetaunce, that ye might afterwarde haue beleued him.","33":"Heare another parable. There was a certayne houssholder which planted a vynyarde, and hedged it roude aboute, and dygged a wyne presse in it, and built a tower, and let it out vnto hussbandmen, and wente in to a straunge countre.","34":"Now wha the tyme of the frute drew neare, he sent his seruautes to the hussbandmen, to receaue the frutes of it.","35":"Then the hussbandmen caught his seruauntes: one they bett, another they kylled, the thirde they stoned.","36":"Agayne, he sent other seruauntes, moo then the first, and they dyd vnto them in like maner.","37":"At the last he sent his owne sonne vnto them, and sayde: they wyl stode in awe of my sonne.","38":"But whe the hussbandme sawe the sonne, they sayde amonge the selues: This is the Heyre, come, let us kyl hym, and take his inheritauce vnto oure selues.","39":"And they caught him, and thrust him out of the vynyarde, & slew him.","40":"Now whe the lorde of the vynyarde commeth, what wyl he do wt those hussbandmen?","41":"They sayde vnto him: He wyl cruelly destroye those euell personnes, & let out his vyniarde vnto other hussbadmen, which shal delyuer him the frute at tymes conuenyent.","42":"Iesus sayde vnto the: Dyd ye neuer rede in the scriptures: The same stone which the buylders refused, is become the heade stone in the corner? This was the LORDES doynge, & it is maruelous i oure eyes","43":"Therfore I saie vnto you: The kingdome of God shalbe take fro you, & shalbe geue vnto the Heithe, which shal brynge forth ye frutes of it.","44":"And who so falleth vpo this stone, shalbe broke in peces: & loke vpo whom it falleth, it shal grynde him to poulder.","45":"And when the hye prestes & Pharises herde his parables, they perceaued, that he spake of them.","46":"And they wente aboute to take him, but they feared ye people, because they helde hi for a prophet."}
