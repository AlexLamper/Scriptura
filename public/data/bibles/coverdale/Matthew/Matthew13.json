{"1":"The same daye wente Iesus out of ye house, and sat by the see syde,","2":"& moch people resorted vnto him: so yt he wete in to a shyppe and satt him downe, and all the people stode vpo the shore.","3":"And he spake many thinges vnto the in symilitudes, sayenge: Beholde, The sower wente forth to sowe:","4":"and as he sowed, some fell by the waye syde: Then came the foules, & ate it vp.","5":"Some fell vpon stony grounde, & anone it spronge vp, because it had no depth of earth:","6":"But whan the Sonne arose, it caught heate: and for so moch as it had no rote, it withred awaye.","7":"Some fell amoge the thornes, & the thornes grewe vp, and choked it.","8":"Some fell vpo good groude, & gaue frute: some an hundreth folde, some sixtie folde, some thirtie folde.","9":"Who so hath eares to heare, let hi heare.","10":"And the disciples came vnto him, and sayde: Why speakest thou to the by parables?","11":"He answered and sayde vnto the: Vnto you it is geuen to knowe the mystery of the kingdome of heauen, but vnto them it is not geuen.","12":"For whoso hath, vnto him shal be geue, and he shal haue abundaunce. But who so hath not, from him shalbe taken awaye, eue that he hath.","13":"Therfore speake I vnto the by parables, for with seynge eyes they se not, & with hearinge eares they heare not, for they vnderstonde it not.","14":"And in them is fulfilled ye prophecie of Esay, which sayeth: Ye shal heare in dede, and shal not vnderstonde: and with seinge eyes shal ye se, and not perceaue.","15":"For ye hert of this people is waxed grosse, & their eares are thick of hearige, & their eyes haue they closed, lest they shulde once se wt ye eyes, & heare wt the eares, & vnderstode wt the hert, & turne, that I might heale them.","16":"But blessed are youre eyes, for they se: & youre eares, for they heare.","17":"Verely I saye vnto you: Many prophetes & righteous men haue desyred to se ye thinges that ye se, and haue not sene the: and to heare the thinges that ye heare, and haue not herde the.","18":"Heare ye therfore the parable of the sower.","19":"Whan one heareth ye worde of the kyngdome, and vnderstondeth it not, the euell man cometh, and plucketh it awaye that is sowne in his hert: & this is he yt is sowne by the waye syde.","20":"But he yt is sowne in the stonye grounde, is this: wha one heareth the worde, & anone with ioye receaueth it:","21":"neuertheles he hath no rote i him, but endureth for a season: wha trouble & persecucion aryseth because of the worde, immediatly he his offended.","22":"As for him that is sowne amonge ye thornes, this is he: Wha one heareth the worde, & the carefulnes of this worlde, & the disceatfulnes of riches choke the worde, & so he becometh vnfrutefull.","23":"But he yt is sowne in the good grounde, is this: whan one heareth the worde, and vnderstondeth it, and bringeth forth frute: and some geueth an hudreth folde, some sixtie folde, and some thirtie folde.","24":"Another parable put he forth vnto the, & sayde: The kyngdome of heaue is like vnto a man, yt sowed good sede in his felde.","25":"But whyle me slepte, there came an enemye, and sowed tares amonge ye wheate, & wente his waye.","26":"Now wha the blade was sproge vp & brought forth frute, the ye tares appeared also.","27":"Then came the seruautes to ye housholder, & sayde vnto him: Syr, sowdest not thou good sede in yi felde? Fro whece the hath it tares?","28":"He sayde vnto the: that hath the enemye done. The sayde ye seruautes: wilt thou then yt we go & wede the out?","29":"He sayde: No, lest whyle ye wede out ye tares, ye plucke vp the wheate also wt the.","30":"Let the both growe together tyll the haruest, and in tyme of haruest I wil saye vnto the reapers: Gather ye tares first, & bynde the in sheeues to be bret: but gather the wheate in to my barne.","31":"Another parable put he forth vnto the, and sayde: The kyngdome of heauen is like vnto a grane of mustarde sede, which a man toke, and sowed it in his felde.","32":"Which is the leest amonge all sedes. But whan it is growne, it is the greatest amonge herbes, and is a tre: so that the byrdes vnder the heauen come and dwell in the braunches of it.","33":"Another parable spake he vnto the: The kyngdome of heaue is like vnto leue, which a woman toke, and myxte it amonge thre peckes of meele, tyll all was leuended.","34":"All soch thinges spake Iesus vnto ye people by parables, & without parables spake he nothinge vnto the:","35":"yt the thinge might be fulfilled, which was spoke by ye prophet, sayenge: I wil open my mouth in parables, and wil speake out the secretes from the begynnynge of the worlde.","36":"Then sent Iesus the people awaye, and came home. And his disciples came vnto hi, and sayde: Declare vnto us ye parable of ye tares of ye felde.","37":"Iesus answered, and sayde vnto them: He that soweth the good sede, is the sonne of man:","38":"the felde is the worlde: ye good sede are the childre of the kyngdome: The tares are the children of wickednes:","39":"ye enemye that soweth the, is the deuell: ye haruest is the ende of the worlde: ye reapers are ye angels.","40":"For like as ye tares are weded out, and brent in the fyre, eue so shal it go in ye ende of this worlde.","41":"The sonne of man shal sende forth his angels, & they shal gather out of his kingdome all thinges yt offende, & the yt do iniquyte,","42":"& shal cast the in to a fornace of fyre, there shalbe waylinge and gnasshinge of teth.","43":"The shal the righteous shyne as the Sonne, in the kyngdome of their father. Who so hath eares to heare, let him heare.","44":"Agayne, the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a treasure hyd in the felde, which a ma founde and hid it, and for ioye therof he wete & solde all yt he had, and bought yt felde.","45":"Agayne, the kyngdome of heauen is like vnto a marchaut, yt sought good pearles:","46":"& wha he had founde a precious pearle, he wete and solde all that he had, & bought it.","47":"Agayne, ye kyngdome of heaue is like vnto a nett cast in to ye see, wherwith are take all maner of fyshes:","48":"& wha it is ful, me drawe it out vnto ye shore, & sytt & gather ye good i to the vessels, but cast the bad awaye.","49":"So shal it be also in ye ende of ye worlde. The angels shal go out, & seuer the bad fro the righteous,","50":"& shal cast the in to a fornace of fyre, there shalbe waylinge & gnasshinge of teth.","51":"And Iesus sayde vnto them: Haue ye vnderstode all these thinges? They sayde: Yee LORDE.","52":"Then sayde he vnto the: Therfore euery scribe taught vnto ye kingdome of heauen, is like an houssholder, which bryngeth out of his treasure thinges new and olde.","53":"And it came to passe wha Iesus had ended these parables, he departed thence,","54":"and came in to his owne coutre, and taught the in their synagoges: in so moch, that they were astonnyed and sayde: Whece cometh soch wyssdome & power vnto him?","55":"Is not this the carpeters sonne? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brethre Iames & Ioses, and Symon and Iude?","56":"And are not all his sisters here with us? Whence hath he the all these thinges?","57":"And they were offended at him. But Iesus sayde vnto the: A prophet is nowhere lesse sett by, the at home & amonge his owne.","58":"And he dyd not many miracles there, because of their vnbeleue."}
