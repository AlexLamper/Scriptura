Then came the foules vnder the heauen, and ate it vp.","5":"Some fell vpon stonye grounde, where it had not moch earth: and anone it came vp, because it had not depe earth.","6":"Now wha the Sonne arose, it caught heate: and in so moch as it had no rote, it wythred awaye.","7":"And some fel amonge the thornes, & the thornes grew vp, and choked it, and it gaue no frute.","8":"And some fell vpon a good grounde, which gaue frute, that came vp and grew. And some bare thirtie folde, and some sixtie folde, and some an hundreth folde,","9":"And he sayde vnto them: Who so hath eares to heare, let him heare.","10":"And whan he was alone, they that were aboute him wt the twolue, axed him concernynge this parable.","11":"And he sayde vnto the: Vnto you it is geuen, to knowe the mystery of the kyngdome of God: but vnto them that are without, all thinges happen by parables,","12":"that with seynge eyes they maye se, and not discerne: and that with hearinge eares they maye heare, and not vnderstode, lest at eny tyme they turne, and their synnes be forgeuen them.","13":"And he sayde vnto them: Vnderstonde ye not this parable? How wyl ye then vnderstonde all other parables?","14":"The sower soweth the worde.","15":"These be they that are by the waye syde: where the worde is sowne, and as soone as they haue herde it, immediatly commeth Satha, and taketh awaye the worde that was sowen in their hertes.","16":"And likewyse are they that are sowen on the stonye grounde: which when they haue herde the worde, receaue it with ioye,","17":"and haue no rote in them: but endure for a tyme. When trouble and persecucion aryseth for ye wordes sake, immediatly they are offended.","18":"And these are they that are sowen amoge the thornes: which heare the worde,","19":"and ye carefulues of this worlde, and the disceatfulnes of riches, and many other lustes entre in, and choke the worde, and so is it made vnfrutefull.","20":"And these are they yt are sowen vpo a good grounde: Which heare ye worde, and receaue it, and brynge forth frute: some thirtie folde, and some sixtie folde, and some an hundreth folde.","21":"And he sayde vnto the: Is a candle lighted to be put vnder a busshell, or vnder a table?

With what measure ye mete, with the same shal it be measured vnto you agayne. And vnto you that heare this, shal more be geuen.","25":"For who so hath, vnto him shal be geuen: and who so hath not, from him shalbe taken awaye, euen that he hath.","26":"And he sayde: The kyngdome of God is after this maner, as when a man casteth sede vpon the londe,","27":"and slepeth, and stondeth vp night and daye, and the sede spryngeth vp, & groweth, he not knowinge of it.","28":"(For the earth bryngeth forth frute of her selfe: first the grasse, afterwarde the eare, then the full wheate in the eare)","29":"But whan she hath brought forth the frute, he putteth to the syckell, because the haruest is come.","30":"And he sayde: Where vnto wyl we licken the kyngdome of God? Or by what symilitude wyl we compare it?","31":"It is like a grayne of mustarde sede, which wha it is sowe vpo the londe, is the leest amonge all sedes of the earth.","32":"And wha it is sowen, it groweth vp, and is greater then all herbes, and getteth greate braunches, so yt the foules vnder the heaue maye dwell vnder ye shadowe therof.","33":"And by many soch parables he spake the worde vnto the, there after as they might heare it,","34":"& without parables spake he nothinge vnto them: but vnto his disciples he expounded all thinges pryuately.","35":"And the same daye at euen he sayde vnto them: let us passe ouer.","36":"And they let the people go, and toke him as he was in the shippe, and there were mo shippes with him.","37":"And there arose a greate storme of wynde, and dasshed the wawes in to the shippe, so that the shippe was full.","38":"And he was behynde in the shippe and slepte vpon a pelowe. And they awoke him & sayde vnto him: Master, Carest thou not, that we perishe?","39":"And he arose, and rebuked ye wynde, and sayde vnto the see: Peace, and be styll, And the wynde was layed, & there folowed a greate calme.","40":"And he sayde vnto them: Why are ye so fearfull? How is it, that ye haue no faith?","41":"And they feared exceadingly, & sayde one to another: What is he this? For wynde and see are obedient vnto him."}
