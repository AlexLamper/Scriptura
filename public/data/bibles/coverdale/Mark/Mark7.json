And many other thynges there be, which they haue taken vpon them to obserue, as the washinge of cuppes and cruses, and brasen vessels and tables.","5":"Then the Pharises and scrybes axed him: Why walke not thy disciples after the tradicions of the elders, but eate bred with vnwasshen handes?","6":"But he answered & sayde vnto them: Full well hath Esay prophecied of you Ypocrytes, as it is wrytte: This people honoureth me wt their lippes, but their hert is farre fro me.","7":"But in vayne do they serue me, whyle they teach soch doctrynes as are nothinge but the commaundemetes of me.","8":"Ye leaue the comaundement of God and kepe the tradicions of men, as the wasshynge of cruses and cuppes, & many soch thinges do ye.","9":"And he saide vnto the: How goodly haue ye cast asyde the comaundement of God, to manteyne youre owne tradicions?","10":"For Moses sayde: Honoure father & mother. Whoso curseth father and mother, shal dye the death.","11":"But ye saye: A ma shal saye to father or mother: Corban, that is, The thinge yt I shulde helpe the withall, is geue vnto God.","12":"And thus ye suffre him nomore to do ought for his father or his mother,","13":"& make Gods worde of none effecte, thorow youre owne tradicions that ye haue set vp.
