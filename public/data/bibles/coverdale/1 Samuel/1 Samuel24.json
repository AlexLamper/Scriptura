But Dauid and his men sat behinde within the caue.","4":"Then sayde Dauids men vnto him: Lo, this is the daye, wherof the LORDE thy God hath sayde vnto the: Beholde, I wyll delyuer thyne enemye in to thy hande, that thou mayest do wt him what it pleaseth the. And Dauid stode vp, & cut of the typpe of Sauls garment quyetly.","5":"Neuertheles it smote him afterwarde in his hert, because he had cut of the typpe of Sauls garment,","6":"and sayde vnto his men: The LORDE let that be farre frome, that I shulde do it, & laye my hande vpo my lorde the LORDES anoyntd: for he is ye anoynted of the LORDE.","7":"And Dauid withelde his seruautes with wordes, & suffred the not to ryse vp agaynst Saul.

And Saul loked behynde him. And Dauid bowed downe his face to the earth, and worshipped,","9":"and sayde vnto Saul: Why herkenest thou vnto the wordes of men, that saye: Dauid seketh thy mysfortune?","10":"Beholde, thine eyes se this daye that the LORDE gaue the into my hande in the caue, and I was counceled to slaye the: Neuertheles thou wast fauoured, for I sayde: I wil not laye my hande vpon my lorde, for he is the LORDES anoynted.","11":"Beholde, my father the typpe of thy garment in my hande, that I wolde not slaye the, whan I cut of the typpe of thy garment. Knowe and se, yt there is no euell ner trespace in my hande: nether haue I offended the, and thou folowest after my soule, to take it awaye.","12":"The LORDE shal be iudge betwene me and the, and auenge me on the, but my hade shal not be vpon the,","13":"acordinge as it is sayde after the olde prouerbe: Vngodlynes commeth of the vngodly: but my hande shal not be vpon the.","14":"Whom persecutest thou O kynge of Israel, whom persecutest thou? a deed dogg? a flee?","15":"The LORDE be iudge, and geue sentence betwene me and the, and cosidre it, and defende my cause, and delyuer me from thy hande.","16":"Now whan Dauid had spoken out these wordes vnto Saul, Saul saide: Is not this thy voyce my sonne Dauid?
