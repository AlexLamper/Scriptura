{"1":"After this there shal come a rod forth of ye Kynrede of Iesse, and a blossome out of his rote.","2":"The sprete of the LORDE shal light vpon it: the sprete of wysdome, and vnderstondinge: the sprete of councel, and strength: ye sprete of knowlege, and of the feare of God:","3":"and shal make him feruent in the feare of God. For he shal not geue sentece, after the thinge yt shal be brought before his eies, nether reproue a matter at the first hearinge:","4":"but with rightousnesse shal he iudge the poore, and with holynes shal he refourme the symple of the worlde. He shal smyte ye worlde with ye staff of his mouth, & with ye breath of his mouth shal he slaye the wicked.","5":"Rightuousnesse shalbe the gyrdle of his loynes, treuth and faithfulnesse the gyrdinge vp of his raynes.","6":"The shal ye wolfe dwel with the labe, and the leoparde shal lye downe by the gote. Bullokes, lyons and catel shal kepe company together, so that a litle childe shal dryue them forth.","7":"The cowe and the Bere shal fede together, and their yongones shal lye together. The lyo shal eate strawe like the oxe, or the cowe.","8":"The childe whyle he sucketh, shal haue a desyre to the serpentes nest, and whe he is weened, he shal put his hande in to the Cockatryce denne.","9":"Noman shal do euel to another, no man shal destro another, in all the hill of my Sanctuary. For the earth shalbe ful of ye knowlege of ye LORDE, euen as though the water of the see flowed ouer the earth.","10":"Then shal the Gentiles enquere after the rote of Iesse (which shalbe set vp for a token vnto the Gentiles) for his dwellinge shalbe glorious.","11":"At the same tyme shal the LORDE take in honde agayne, to conquere ye remnaunt of his people (which are lefft alyue) From the Assirias, Egiptians, Arabians, Morians, Elamites, Caldeyes, Antiochias and Ilodes of the see.","12":"And he shal set vp a toke amonge the Gentiles, and gather together ye dispersed of Israel, yee and the outcastes of Iuda from the foure corners of ye worlde.","13":"The hatred of Ephraim, and ye enmyte of Iuda shalbe clene rooted out. Ephraim shal beare no euel wil to Iuda, and Iuda shal not hate Ephraim:","14":"but they both together shal flye vpo the shulders of the Philistynes toward the West, and spoyle them together that dwell toward the East. The Idumytes and the Moabites shal let their hodes fall, and the Ammonites shalbe obedient vnto them.","15":"The LORDE also shal cleue the tunges of the Egipcias see, and with a mightie wynde shal he lift vp his honde ouer Nilus, and shal smyte his seue streames and make men go ouer drye shod.","16":"And thus shal he make a waye for his people, yt remayneth from the Assirians, like as it happened to ye Israelites, what tyme they departed out of the londe of Egipte."}
