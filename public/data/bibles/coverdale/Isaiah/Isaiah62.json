Thou shalt be named with a new name, which the mouth of ye LORDE shal shewe.","3":"Thou shalt be a crowne in the honde of the LORDE, and a glorious garlade in the hode of thy God.","4":"From this tyme forth thou shalt neuer be called the forsake, & thy lode shal nomore be called the wildernesse. But thou shalt be called Hephziba (that is, my beloued) & yi londe Beula (that is) a maried woma: for ye LORDE loueth ye, & thy lode shalbe inhabited.","5":"And like as yonge ma taketh a doughter to mariage, so shal God mary himself vnto yi sonnes. And as a brydegrome is glad of his bryde, so shal God reioyse ouer the.","6":"I wil set watchme vpo thy walles (o Ierusalem) which shall nether ceasse daye nor night, to preach ye LORDE.
