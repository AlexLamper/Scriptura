{"1":"Come to the waters all ye, yt be thurstie, & ye that haue no moneye. Come, bye, that ye maye haue to eate. Come, bye wyne & mylck, without eny money, or moneye worth,","2":"Wherfore do ye laye out yor moneye, for the thinge yt fedeth not, and spende youre laboure aboute the thinge that satisfieth you not? But herke rather vnto me, ad ye shal eate of the best, & youre soule shal haue hir pleasure in pleteousnes.","3":"Enclyne youre eares, & come vnto me, take hede & youre soule shal lyue. For I will make an euerlastinge couenaunt with you, eue the sure mercies of Dauid.","4":"Beholde, I shal geue him for a witnesse amoge ye folke, for a prynce & captayne vnto the people.","5":"Lo, thou shalt call an vnknowne people: & a people that had no knowlege of the, shall runne vnto the: because off the LORDE thy God, ye holy one of Israel, which glorifieth the.","6":"Seke the LORDE while he maye be founde, call vpo him while he is nye.","7":"Let the vngodly man forsake his wayes, ad the vnrightuous his ymaginacios, & turne agayne vnto the LORDE, so shal he be merciful vnto him: and to oure God, for he is redy to forgeue.","8":"For thus saieth the LORDE: My thoughtes are not youre thoughtes, & youre wayes are not my wayes:","9":"But as farre as the heauens are hyer then the earth, so farre do my waies exceade yours, & my thoughtes yours","10":"And like as the rayne & snowe cometh downe from heaue, & returneth not thither agayne, but watereth the earth, maketh it frutefull & grene, that it maye geue corne & breade vnto the sower:","11":"So the worde also that commeth out of my mouth, shal not turne agayne voyde vnto me, but shal accoplish my wil & prospere in the thinge, wherto I sende it.","12":"And so shal ye go forth wt ioye, & be led with peace. The mountaynes and hilles shal synge with you for ioye, and all the trees of the felde shal clappe their hondes.","13":"For thornes, there shal growe Fyrre trees, & ye Myrte tre in the steade of breres. And this shal be done to the prayse of the LORDE, & for an euerlastinge toke, that shal not be taken awaye."}
