{"1":"The heuy burthen, apon the valley of Visions. What hast thou there to do, that thou clymnest vp in to the house toppe,","2":"o thou citie of miracles, sedicious and wilfull? seinge, thy slayne me are nether killed wt swerde, ner deed in batel?","3":"For all thy captaynes gat them to their horses from the ordinaunce, yee they are altogether rydden awaye, and fled farre of.","4":"When I perceaued yt, I sayde: awaye fro me, yt I maye wepe bytterly. Take no laboure for to coforte me, as touchinge the destruction of my people.","5":"For this is ye daye of the LORDE of hoostes, wherin he will plage, treade downe, and wede out the valley of Visios, and breake downe the walles, with soch a crack, that it shal geue a sownde in the mountaynes.","6":"I sawe the Elamites take the quyuers to carte and to horse, and that the walles were bare from harnesse.","7":"Thy goodly valleys were ful of Charettes, the horse men made them soone to besege the gates.","8":"Then was the coueringe of Iuda put from thence, and then was sene the sege of the tymbre house.","9":"There shal ye se the riftes in the walles of the cite of Dauid, wherof there shalbe many.
