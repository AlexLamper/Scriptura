{"1":"Thus saieth the LORDE: Where is the bill of yor mothers deuorcemet, that I sent vnto her? or who is the vsurer, to who I solde you? Beholde, for youre owne offeces are ye solde: & because of youre transgression, is youre mother forsake.","2":"For why wolde no ma receaue me, when I came? & when I called, no man gaue me answere. Was my hode clene smyte of, that it might not helpe? or, had I not power to delyuer? lo, at a worde I drike vp the see, & of water floudes I make drie lode: so yt for want of water, the fish corruppe, and die of thurst.","3":"As for heauen, I clooth it with darcknesse, and put a sack vpon it.","4":"The LORDE God hath geue me a wel lerned tuge, so that I can conforte them which are troubled, yee & yt in due season. He waked myne eare vp by tymes in ye mornynge (as ye scolemasters do) yt I might herke.","5":"The LORDE God hath opened myne eare, therfore ca I not saye naye, ner wt drawe myself,","6":"but I offre my backe vnto ye smyters, and my chees to the nyppers. I turne not my face fro shame ad spittinge,","7":"for the LORDE God helpeth me, therfore shal I not be cofounded. I haue hardened my face like a flynt stone, for I am sure, that I shal not come to confucion.","8":"Myne aduocate speaketh for me, who wil then go with me to lawe? Let vs stode one agaynst another: yf there be eny that wil reason with me, let him come here forth to me.","9":"Beholde, the LORDE God stondeth by me, what is he that can condempne me? lo, they shalbe all like as an olde cloth, which ye mothes shal eate vp.","10":"Therfore who so feareth the LORDE amoge you, let him heare the voyce of his seruaut. Who so walketh in darcknesse, & no light shyneth vpo him, let him hope in the LORDE, and holde him by his God.","11":"But take hede, ye haue all kyndled a fyre, and gyrded youre selues with the flame: Ye walke in the glistrige of youre owne fyre, and in the flame that ye haue kyndled. This cometh vnto you fro my honde, namely, yt ye shal slepe in sorowe."}
