{"1":"What is he this, that cometh from Edom, with stayned reade clothes of Bosra: (which is so costly, cloth) & cometh in so neebly with all his stregth? I am he yt teacheth rightuousnes, & am of power to helpe.","2":"Wherfore the is thy clothinge reade, & thy raymet like his yt treadeth in ye wyne presse?","3":"I haue trodde the presse my self alone, & of all people, there was not one with me. Thus haue I trode downe myne enemies in my wrath, and set my fete vpo them in my indignacion: And their bloude sprange vpo my cloothes, & so haue I stayned all my rayment.","4":"For the daye of vengeauce that I haue take in honde, & the yeare of my delyueraunce is come.","5":"I loked aboute me, and there was no ma to shewe me eny helpe, I fel downe, and no man helde me vp. The I helde me by myne owne arme, & my feruetnesse susteyned me.","6":"And thus haue I troden downe the people in my wrath, and bathed them in my displeasure: In so moch that I haue shed their bloude vpon the earth.","7":"I will declare the goodnesse of the LORDE, yee and the prayse of the LORDE for all that he hath gyuen vs, for the greate good yt he hath done for Israel: which he hath gyuen them of his owne fauoure, & acordinge to the multitude of his louynge kindnesses.","8":"For he sayde: These no doute wilbe my people, and no shrekinge children, and so he was their Sauioure.","9":"In their troubles he forsoke the not, but the angel that went forth from his presence, delyuered them: Of very loue & kindnesse that he had vnto them, redemed he them. He hath borne them, and caried them vp euer, sence the worlde begane.","10":"But after they prouoked him to wrath and vexed his holy minde, he was their enemie, and fought agaynst them him self.","11":"Yet remebred he the olde tyme, of Moses & his people: How he brought them from the water of the see, as a shepherde doth with his shepe: how he had geuen his holy sprete amonge them:","12":"how he had led Moses by the right honde with his glorious arme: how he had deuyded the water before them (wherby he gat him self an euerlastinge name)","13":"how he led them in the depe, as an horse is led in the playne, that they shulde not stomble.","14":"The sprete of the LORDE led them, as a tame beast goeth in the felde. Thus (o God) hast thou led thy people, to make thy self a glorious name with all.","15":"Loke downe then from heaue, and beholde the dwellinge place of thy sanctuary & thy glory. How is it, yt thy gelousy, thy strength, the multitude of thy mercies and thy louynge kyndnesse, wyl not be entreated of vs?","16":"Yet art thou or father: For Abraham knoweth vs not, nether is Israel acquanted with vs. But thou LORDE art oure father and redemer, and thy name is euer lastinge.","17":"O LORDE wherfore hast thou led vs out of thy waye? wherfore hast thou hardened oure hertes, that we feare the not? Be at one with vs agayne, for thy seruauntes sake yt are of the generacio of thy heretage.","18":"Thy people hath had but litle of thy Sanctuary in possessio, for oure enemies haue take it in:","19":"And we are become, euen as we were from the beginnynge: but thou art not their LORDE, for they haue not called vpon thy name."}
