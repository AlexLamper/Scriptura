{"1":"Herken vnto me, ye that holde of rightuousnes, ye that seke the LORDE. Take hede vnto the stone, wherout ye are hewen, and to the graue wherout ye are digged.","2":"Considre Abraham youre father, & Sara that bare you: how that I called him alone, prospered him wel, & encreased him:","3":"how the LORDE conforted Sio, and repayred all hir decaye: makinge hir deserte as a Paradise, and hir wildernesse as the garden of the LORDE. Myrth and ioye was there, thankesgeuynge and ye voyce of prayse.","4":"Haue respecte vnto me then (o my people) and laye thine eare to me: for a lawe, and an ordinaunce shal go forth fro me, to lighten the Gentiles.","5":"It is hard by, that my health & my rightuousnesse shal go forth, and the people shalbe ordred with myne arme. The Ilondes (that is ye Gentiles) shal hope in me, and put their trust in myne arme.","6":"Lift vp youre eyes toward heaue, and loke vpon the earth beneth. For the heauens shal vanish awaye like smoke, and the earth shall teare like a clothe, & they that dwel therin, shal perish in like maner. But my health endureth for euer, and my rightuousnes shall not ceasse.","7":"Therfore hercken vnto me, ye yt haue pleasure in rightuousnes, thou people that bearest my lawe in thine herte. Feare not the curse of men, be not afrayde of their blasphemies & reuylinges:","8":"for wormes & mothes shal eat the vp like clothe & woll. But my rightuousnesse shal endure for euer, & my sauynge health from generacion to generacion.","9":"Wake vp, wake vp, & be stronge: O thou arme of the LORDE: wake vp, lyke as in tymes past, euer and sence the worlde beganne.","10":"Art not thou he, that hast wounded that proude lucifer, and hewen the dragon in peces? Art not thou euen he, which hast dried vp the depe of the see, which hast made playne the see grounde, that the delyuered might go thorow?","11":"That the redemed of the LORDE, which turned agayne, might come with ioye vnto Sio, there to endure for euer? That myrth and gladnesse might be with them: that sorowe & wo might fle from the?","12":"Yee I, I am eue he, that in all thiges geueth you consolacion. What art thou then, that fearest a mortall ma, ye childe of man, which goeth awaye as doeth the floure?","13":"And forgettest the LORDE that made the, that spred out the heauens, and layde the foundacion of the earth. But thou art euer afrayde for the sight of thyne oppressoure, which is ready to do harme: Where is the wrath of the oppressoure?","14":"It cometh on fast, it maketh haist to apeare: It shal not perish, yt it shulde not be able to destroye, nether shal it fayle for faute of norishinge.","15":"I am the LORDE yi God, that make the see to be still, and to rage: whose name is the LORDE of hoostes.","16":"I shal put my worde also in thy mouth, and defende the with the turnynge of my honde: that thou mayest plante the heauens, and laye the foundacions of the earth, and saye vnto Sion: thou art my people.","17":"Awake, Awake, and stonde vp o Ierusalem, thou that from the honde of the LORDE, hast dronke out the cuppe of his wrath: thou that hast supped of, and sucked out the slombringe cuppe to the botome.","18":"For amonge all the sonnes whom thou hast begotten, there is not one that maye holde the vp: and not one to lede the by the honde, of all the sonnes that thou hast norished.","19":"Both these thinges are happened vnto the, but who is sory for it? Yee, destruction, waistinge, hunger & swerde: but who hath conforted the?","20":"Thy sonnes lie comfortles at ye heade of euery strete like a take venyson, & are ful of ye terrible wrath of ye LORDE, & punyshmet of thy God.","21":"And therfore thou miserable & dronke (howbe it not wt wyne) Heare this:","22":"Thus saieth thy LORDE: thy LORDE & God, ye defender of his people: Beholde, I wil take ye slobrige cuppe out of thy hode, eue ye cuppe wt the dregges of my wrath: yt fro hence forth thou shalt neuer drinke it more,","23":"& wil put it i their hode that trouble the: which haue spoken to thy soule: stoupe downe, that we maye go ouer the: make thy body eaue with the grounde, and as the strete to go vpon."}
