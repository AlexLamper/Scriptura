{"1":"Bvt now, the LORDE that made the (o Iacob) and he that fashioned the (o Israel) saieth thus: Feare not, for I will defende ye. I haue called ye by thy name, thou art myne owne.","2":"When thou wentest in the water, I was by the, that the stroge floudes shulde not pluck ye awaye: When thou walkest in the fyre, it shal not burne ye, and the flame shall not kindle vpon the.","3":"For I am the LORDE thy God, the holyone of Israel, thy Sauioure. I gaue Egipte for yi delyueraunce, the Moryas and the Sabees for the:","4":"because thou wast deare in my sight, and because I set by the, and loued the. I pilled all men for the, and delyuered vp all people for thy sake,","5":"that thou shuldest not feare, for I was with the. I wil bringe thy sede from the east, and gather the together from the west.","6":"I wil saye to the north: let go. And to the south, kepe not backe: But bringe me my sonnes from farre, and my doughters from the endes of the worlde:","7":"Namely, all those that be called after my name: For the haue I created, fashioned, and made for myne honoure.","8":"Bringe forth that people, whether they haue eyes or be blynde, deaf or haue eares.","9":"All nacions shal come in one, and be gathered in one people. But which amonge yonder goddes shall declare soch thinges, & tell vs what is to come? Let them bringe their witnesses, so shal they be fre: for the men shal heare it, and saye: it is truth.","10":"But I bringe you witnesses (saith the LORDE) euen those that are my seruauntes, whom I haue chosen: to the intent that ye might be certified, and geue me faithful credence: yee and to cosidre, that I am he, before whom there was neuer eny God, and that there shalbe none after me.","11":"I am only the LORDE, and without me is there no Sauioure.","12":"I geue warnynge, I make whole, I teach you, that there shulde be no straunge God amonge you. And this recorde must ye beare me youre selues (saieth the LORDE) that I am God.","13":"And euen he am I from the begynnynge, and there is none, that can take eny thinge out of my honde. And what I do, can no man chaunge.","14":"Thus saieth the LORDE the holy one of Israel youre redemer: For youre sake I will sende to Babilon, and bringe all the strongest of them from thence: Namely, the Caldees that boost them of their shippes:","15":"Euen I the LORDE youre holy one which haue made Israel, and am youre kinge.","16":"Morouer, thus saieth the LORDE (Euen he that maketh a waye in the see, and a footpath in the mightie waters:","17":"which bringeth forth the charettes and horses, the hooste and the power, that they maye fall a slepe and neuer ryse, and be extincte, like as tow is quenched.","18":"Ye remembre not thinges of olde, and regarde nothinge that is past.","19":"Therfore beholde, I shal make a new thinge, and shortly shall it apeare: Ye shall well knowe it, I tolde it you afore, but I will tell it you agaane. I will make stretes in the deserte, and ryuers of water in the wildernesse.","20":"The wilde beastes shal worshippe me: the dragon, and the Estrich. For I shall geue water in ye wildernesse, and streames in the deserte: that I maye geue drike to my people, whom I chose.","21":"This people haue I made for my self, and they shal shewe forth my prayse.","22":"For thou (Iacob) woldest not call vpon me, but thou haddest an vnlust towarde me, o Israel.","23":"Thou gauest me not thy yonge beastes for burntoffringes, nether didest honoure me with thy sacrifices. Thou boughtest me no deare spice with thi money, nether pouredest the fat of thy sacrifices vpon me. Howbeit I haue not bene chargeable vnto the in offriges, nether greuous in Incense.","24":"But thou hast lade me with thy synnes, and weeried me with thy vngodlynes:","25":"Where as I yet am euen he only, that for myne owne selfes sake do awaye thine offences, & forget thy synnes: so that I wil neuer thinke vpon them.","26":"Put me now in remembraunce (for we will reason together) & shewe what thou hast for the, to make the quyte.","27":"Thy first father offended sore, and thy rulers haue synned agaynst me","28":"Therfore I ether suspended, or slewe the chefest prynces: I dyd curse Iacob, and gaue Israel into reprofe."}
