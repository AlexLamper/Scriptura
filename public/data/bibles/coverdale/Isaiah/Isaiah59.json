{"1":"Beholde the LORDES honde is not so shortened yt it can not helpe, nether is his eare so stopped yt it maye not heare.","2":"But yor my?dedes haue separated you from yor God, & yor synnes hyde his face from you, yt he heareth you not.","3":"For yor hondes are defyled with bloude, and yor fyngers wt vnrighteousnesse: Yor lippes speake lesynges, & yor tonge setteth out wickednes.","4":"No man regardeth righteousnes, & no ma iudgeth truly Euery man hopeth in vayne thinges, and ymagineth disceate, coceaueth weerynesse, & bringeth forth euell.","5":"They brede cockatrice egges, & weeue ye spyders webb. Who so eateth of their egges, dieth. But yf one treade vpon the, there cometh vp a serpent.","6":"Their webbe maketh no clothe, & they maye not couer the wt their labours. Their dedes are ye dedes of wickednes, & ye worke of robbery is in their hodes.","7":"Their fete runne to euell, & they make haist to shed innocet bloude. Their coucels are wicked coucels, harme & destruccio are in their wayes.","8":"But ye waye of peace they knowe not. In their goinges is no equyte, their wayes are so croked, yt who so euer goeth therin, knoweth nothinge of peace.","9":"And this is ye cause yt equite is so farre fro vs, & yt rightuousnes cometh not nye vs. We loke for light, lo, it is darknesse: for ye mornynge shyne, se, we walke in ye darke.","10":"We grope like ye blynde vpon ye wall, we grope euen as one yt hath none eyes. We stomble at ye noone daye, as though it were toward night: in ye fallinge places, like men yt are half deed.","11":"We roare all like Beeres, & mourne stil like doues. We loke for equite, but there is none: for health, but it is farre fro vs.","12":"For or offences are many before ye, & or synnes testifie agaynst vs. Yee we must cofesse yt we offende, & knowlege, yt we do amysse:","13":"Namely, transgresse & dyssemble agaynst ye LORDE, & fall awaye fro or God: vsinge presuptuous & traytorous ymaginacions, & castinge false matters in or hertes.","14":"And therfore is equyte gone asyde, & righteousnes stodeth farre of: treuth is fallen downe in the strete, and the thinge that is playne and open, maye not be shewed.","15":"Yee ye treuth is lade in preson, and he that refrayneth himself fro euel, must be spoyled. When the LORDE sawe this, it displeased him sore, yt there was no where eny equite.","16":"He sawe also, that there was no man, which had pitie therof, or was greued at it. And he helde him by his owne power, and cleued to his owne rightuousnes.","17":"He put rightuousnes vpo him for a brest plate, & set the helmet of health vpo his heade. He put on wrath in steade of clothige, & toke gelousy aboute him for a cloke:","18":"(like as when a man goeth forth wrothfully to recopence his enemies, & to be avenged of his aduersaries.) Namely, that he might recompence and rewarde the Ilodes,","19":"wherthorow the name of the LORDE might be feared, from the risynge of the Sone: and his magesty, vnto the goinge downe of the same. For he shal come as a violent waterstreame, which the wynde of the LORDE hath moued.","20":"But vnto Sion there shal come a redemer, and vnto them in Iacob that turne from wickednesse, saieth the LORDE.","21":"I will make this conuenaunt with them (sayeth ye LORDE): My sprete that is come vpon the, & the wordes which I haue put in yi mouth, shal neuer go out of thy mouth, nor out of ye mouth of thy childre, no ner out of ye mouth of thy childers childre, from this tyme forth for euer more."}
