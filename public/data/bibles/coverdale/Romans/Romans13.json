{"1":"Let euery soule submytte himselfe to the auctorite off the hyer powers. For there is no power but of God.","2":"The powers that be, are ordeyned of God: so that who so euer resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinaunce of God. And they that resiste, shal receaue to them selues danacion.","3":"For rulers are not to be feared for good workes, but for euell. Yf thou wilt be without feare off the power, do well then, and thou shalt haue prayse of the same:","4":"for he is the minister off God for thy wealth. But yff thou do euell, then feare, for he beareth not the swerde for naughte. For he is the mynister of God, a taker of vengeaunce, to punyshe him that doth euell.","5":"Wherfore ye must nedes obeye, not onely for punyshmet, but also because of conscience.","6":"For this cause must ye geue trybute also. For they are Gods mynisters, which mateyne ye same defence.","7":"Geue to euery man therfore his dutye: tribute, to whom tribute belongeth: custome, to whom custome is due: feare, to whom feare belongeth: honoure, to whom honoure pertayneth.","8":"Owe nothinge to eny man, but to loue one another. For he that loueth another, hath fulfylled the lawe.","9":"For where it is sayde: ( Thou shalt not breake wedlocke: thou shalt not kyll: thou shalt not steale: thou shalt not beare false witnesse: thou shalt not lust) and yf there be eny other commaundement, it is compreheded in this worde.Thou shalt loue thy neghboure as thy selfe.","10":"Loue doth his neghboure no euell. Therfore is loue ye fulfillynge of the lawe.","11":"And for so moch as we know this, namely the tyme that the houre is now for vs to ryse from slepe (For now is oure saluacion nearer, then whan we beleued:","12":"the nighte is past, but the daye is come nye.) Let vs therfore cast awaye ye workes of darknesse, and put on the armoure of lighte.","13":"Let vs walke honestly as in the daye, not in excesse off eatinge aud in dronkennesse, not in chamburynge and wantonnesse, not in stryfe and enuyenge:","14":"but put ye on the LORDE Iesus Christ, and make not prouysion for ye flesh, to fulfill the lustes of it."}
