{"1":"Him that is weake in the faith, receaue vnto you, and trouble not the consciences.","2":"One beleueth that he maye eate all thinge: but he that is weake, eateth herbes.","3":"Let not him that eateth, despyse him that eateth not: and let not him which eateth not, iudge him that eateth: for God hath receaued him.","4":"Who art thou, that iudgest another mans seruaut? He stondeth or falleth vnto his LORDE: Yee he maye well stode, for God is able to make hi stode.","5":"Some man putteth differece betwene daye & daye, but another man counteth all dayes alyke. Let euery man be sure of his meanynge.","6":"He that putteth difference in the daye, doth it vnto the LORDE: & he that putteth no differece in the daye, doth it vnto ye LORDE also. He yt eateth, eateth vnto the LORDE, for he geueth God thakes:","7":"and he that eateth not, eateth not vnto ye LORDE, and geueth God thankes.","8":"For none of vs lyueth to himselfe, and none dyeth to him selfe. Yf we lyue, we lyue vnto the LORDE: Yf we dye, we dye vnto the LORDE. Therfore, whether we lyue or dye, we are the LORDES.","9":"For therto dyed Christ, and rose agayne, and reuyued, that he mighte be LORDE both of deed and quycke.","10":"But why iudgest thou yi brother? Or thou other, why despysest thou yi brother? We shal all be broughte before ye iudgmet seate of Christ.","11":"For it is wrytte: As truly as I lyue, (sayeth the LORDE) all knees shal bowe vnto me, & all tuges shal knowlege vnto God.","12":"Thus shal euery one of vs geue acomptes for himselfe vnto God.","13":"Let vs not therfore iudge one another enymore. But iudge this rather, yt noma put a stomblinge blocke or an occasion to fall in his brothers waye.","14":"I knowe, & am full certified in ye LORDE Iesu, yt there is nothinge comen of itselfe: but vnto him yt iudgeth it to be comen, to him is it comen.","15":"But yf yi brother be greued ouer yi meate, the walkest thou not now after charite. Destroye not wt thy meate, him, for whom Christ dyed,","16":"Se therfore that youre treasure be not euell spoke of.","17":"For the kyngdome of God is not meate and drynke, but righteousnes, & peace, and ioye in the holy goost.","18":"He that in these thinges serueth Christ, pleaseth God, & is comended of me.","19":"Let vs therfore folowe those thinges which make for peace, & thinges wherwith one maye edifye another.","20":"Destroye not ye worke of God for eny meates sake. All thinges truly are cleane, but it is euell for yt ma, which eateth wt hurte of his coscience","21":"It is moch better yt thou eate no flesh, and drynke no wyne, nor eny thinge, wherby thy brother stombleth, or falleth, or is made weake.","22":"Hast thou faith, haue it with yi selfe before God Happye is he, that codemneth not him selfe in yt thinge which he aloweth.","23":"But he that maketh conscience of it and yet eateth, is dampned: because he doth it not of faith. For what so euer is not of faith, that same is synne."}
