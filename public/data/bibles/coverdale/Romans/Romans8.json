{"1":"Then is there now no damnacion vnto the that are in Christ Iesu, which walke not after the flesh, but after ye sprete.","2":"For ye lawe of ye sprete (yt bryngeth life i Christ Iesu) hath made me fre fro the lawe of synne & death.","3":"For what vnpossible was vnto ye lawe (in as moch as it was weake because of the flesh) yt perfourmed God, & sent his sonne in ye similitude of synfull flesh,","4":"& by synne daned synne in ye flesh: that the righteousnes requyred of the lawe, mighte be fulfylled in vs, which walke not after the flesh, but after the sprete.","5":"For they that are fleshly, are fleshly mynded: but they that are goostly, are goostly mynded.","6":"To be fleshly mynded, is death: but to be goostly mynded, is life and peace.","7":"For to be fleshly mynded is enemyte agaynst. God, syth it is not subdued vnto ye lawe of God, for it can not also.","8":"As for the that are fleshlye, they can not please God.","9":"Howbeit ye are not fleshly, but goostly, yf so be that the sprete of God dwell in you. But who so hath not the sprete of Christ, the same is not his.","10":"Neuertheles yf Christ be in you, then is the body deed because of synne. But the sprete is life for righteousnes sake.","11":"Wherfore yf the sprete of him, that raysed vp Iesus from the deed, dwell in you, then shal euen he also that raysed vp Christ from the deed, quycke youre mortal bodies, because yt his sprete dwelleth in you.","12":"Therfore brethre we are now detters, not to the flesh,","13":"to lyue after the flesh: for yf ye lyue after ye fleshe, ye must dye: but yf ye mortyfye the dedes of the body thorow the sprete, ye shal lyue.","14":"For who so euer are led by the sprete of God,","15":"are Gods childre: for ye haue not receaued the sprete of bondage to feare eny more, but ye haue receaued ye sprete of adopcion, wherby we crye: Abba, deare father.","16":"The same sprete certifieth oure sprete, that we are the childre of God.","17":"Yf we be childre, then are we heyres also, namely the heyres of God, and heyres annexed with Christ, yf so be that we suffer together, that we maye be also glorified together.","18":"For I suppose, that the affliccions off this tyme, are not worthy of ye glorye, which shalbe shewed vpon vs.","19":"For the feruent loginge of ye creature loketh for the appearinge of the children of God,","20":"because the creature is subdued vnto vanyte agaynst hir will, but for his wyll that hath subdued her vpon hope.","21":"For the creature also shal be fre from the bondage of corrupcion, vnto the glorious libertye of the childre of God.","22":"For we knowe, that euery creature groneth, and trauayleth with vs in payne vnto the same tyme.","23":"Not they only, but we oure selues also, which haue the first frutes of the sprete, grone within in oure selues for the childshippe, and loke for ye delyueraunce of oure bodye.","24":"For we are saued i dede, howbeit i hope: but ye hope that is sene, is no hope: for how can a man hope for that which he seyeth?","25":"But yf we hope for that which we se not, the do we thorow pacience abyde for it.","26":"Likewyse the sprete also helpeth oure weaknesse: for we knowe not what we shulde desyre as we oughte: neuertheles ye sprete it selfe maketh intercession mightely for vs with vnoutspeakable gronynges.","27":"Howbeit he yt searcheth the hert, knoweth what the mynde of the sprete is: for he maketh intercession for the sayntes acordinge to the pleasure of God.","28":"But sure we are, that all thinges serue for the best vnto them that loue of God, which are called of purpose.","29":"For those whom he knewe before, hath he ordeyned also before, yt they shulde be like fashioned vnto ye shappe of his sonne, yt he mighte be the first begotte amoge many brethre.","30":"As for those whom he hath ordeyned before, them hath he called also: and whom he hath called, the hath he also made righteous: and whom he hath made righteous, them hath he glorified also.","31":"What shal we saye then vnto these thinges?
