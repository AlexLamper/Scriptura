{"1":"Brethren, my hertes desyre, & prayer vnto God for Israel is, that they might be saued.","2":"For I beare them recorde, that they are zelous for Gods cause, but not wt vnderstondinge.","3":"For they knowe not the righteousnes which auayleth before God, and go aboute to manteyne their awne righteousnes: and thus they are not subdued vnto the righteousnes, that is off value before God.","4":"For Christ is the ende of the lawe, vnto righteousnes for euery one yt beleueth.","5":"Moses wryteth of ye righteousnes which commeth of the lawe, that the man which doth ye same, shal lyue therin.","6":"But ye righteousnes which cometh of faith, speaketh on this wyse: Saye not in thine hert: Who wil go vp in to heaue? (that is nothinge els then to fetch Christ downe)","7":"Or who wyl go downe in to ye depe? (that is nothinge els the to fetch vp Christ from the deed.)","8":"But what sayeth the scripture? The worde is nye the, euen in thy mouth and in thine hert. This is ye worde of faith yt we preach.","9":"For yf thou knowlegest Iesus with thy mouth, that he is the LORDE, and beleuest in thine hert, that God hath raysed him vp from the deed, thou shalt be saued.","10":"For yf a man beleue from the hert, he shalbe made righteous: and yf a ma knowlege with the mouth, he shal be saued.","11":"For the scripture sayeth: Who so euer beleueth on him, shal not be confounded.","12":"Here is no difference, nether of the Iewe ner of the Gentyle. For one is LORDE of all, which is riche vnto all yt call vpo him.","13":"For who so euer shal call vpon the name of the LORDE, shalbe saued.","14":"But how shal they call vpo him, on who they beleue not? How shal they beleue on him, of who they haue not herde? How shal they heare without a preacher?","15":"But how shal they preach, excepte they be sent? As it is wrytte: How beutyfull are the fete of the yt preach peace, yt brynge good tidinges?","16":"But they are not all obedient vnto the Gospell. For Esaye sayeth: LORDE, who beleueth oure preachinge?","17":"So the faith cometh by hearynge, but hearinge cometh by the worde of God.","18":"But I saye: Haue they not herde? No doute their sounde wete out into all londes, and their wordes in to the endes of the worlde.","19":"But I saye: Hath not Israel knowne? First, Moses sayeth: I wil prouoke you to enuye, by them that are not my people: & by a foolish nacion wyl I anger you.","20":"Esaye after him is bolde, aud sayeth: I am founde of them, that sought me not: & haue appeared vnto them, that axed not after me.","21":"But vnto Israel he sayeth: All the daye loge haue I stretched forth my handes vnto a people yt beleueth not, but speaketh agaynst me."}
