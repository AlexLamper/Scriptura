Knowest thou not, that ye louynge kyndnesse of God leadeth the to repentaunce?","5":"But thou after thine harde and impenitent hert, heapest vnto thy selfe a treasure of wrath, agaynst the daye of wrath and of the openynge of the righteous iudgment of God,","6":"which shal rewarde euery man acordinge to his dedes:","7":"namely, prayse & honoure, and vncorrupcion, vnto them that with pacience in doinge good, seke euerlastinge life:","8":"But vnto them that are contencious & not obedient vnto the trueth, but obeye vnrighteousnes, shal come indignacion and wrath,","9":"trouble and anguysh vpo all the soules of me that do euell, of the Iewe first and also of the Greke:","10":"But vnto all the that do good (shal come) prayse and honoure, and peace, vnto the Iewe first, and also to the Greke.","11":"For there is no respecte of personnes before God: Who so euer haue synned without lawe,","12":"shal perish also without lawe: and whosoeuer haue synned in the lawe, shalbe iudged by the lawe.","13":"For before God, they are not righteous, which heare ye lawe: but they that do the lawe, shalbe iustified.","14":"For yf the Gentyles which haue not the lawe, do of nature the thinges conteyned in the lawe, then they hauynge not the lawe, are a lawe vnto them selues,","15":"in that they shewe, that the worke of ye lawe is wrytte in their hertes: whyle their conscience beareth witnesse vnto the, and also the thoughtes which accuse or excuse them amonge them selues,","16":"in the daye whan God shal iudge the secretes of men by Iesus Christ, acordinge to my Gospell.","17":"But take hede, thou art called a Iewe, and trustest in the lawe, & makest thy boost of God,","18":"and knowest his will: & for so moch as thou art enfourmed out of ye lawe,","19":"thou prouest what is best to do, and presumest to be a leader of the blynde: a lighte of them yt are in darcknes:","20":"an enformer of ye vnwyse: a teacher of ye symple: which hast the ensample of knowlege & of the trueth in the lawe.","21":"Now teachest thou other, and teachest not thy selfe.
