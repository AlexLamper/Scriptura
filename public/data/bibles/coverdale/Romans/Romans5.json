{"1":"Because therfore that we are iustified by faith, we haue peace with God thorow oure LORDE Iesus Christ","2":"by who also we haue an intraunce in faith vnto this grace, wherin we stonde, & reioyse in the hope of ye glorye for to come, which God shal geue.","3":"Not onely yt, but we reioyse also i troubles, for so moch as we knowe, yt trouble bryngeth paciece,","4":"paciece bryngeth experiece, experiece bryngeth hope:","5":"As for hope, is letteth vs not come to cofusion, because the loue of God is shed abrode in oure hertes, by the holy goost which is geuen vnto vs.","6":"For whan we were yet weake acordinge to the tyme, Christ dyed for vs vngodly.","7":"Now dyeth there scace eny man for the righteous sake: Peraduenture for a good man durst one dye.","8":"Therfore doth God set forth his loue towarde vs, in yt Christ dyed for vs,whan we were yet synners:","9":"Moch more then shal we be saued from wrath by him seynge we are now made righteous thorow his bloude.","10":"For yf we were recocyled vnto God by ye death of his sone, wha we were yet enemies: moch more shal we be saued by him, now yt we are reconcyled.","11":"Not onely that, but we reioyse also in God thorow oure LORDE Iesus Christ, by whom we haue now receaued the attonement.","12":"Wherfore as by one man synned entred in to the worlde, and death by ye meanes off synne:","13":"euen so wente death also ouer all men, in so moch as they all haue synned. For synne was in ye worlde vnto the lawe: but where no lawe is, there is not synne regarded.","14":"Neuertheles death reigned from Adam vnto Moses, euen ouer them also that synned not with like trangression as dyd Adam, which is ye ymage of him yt was to come.","15":"But it is not with the gifte as with the synne: for yf thorow the synne of one many be deed, yet moch more plenteously came the grace and gifte of God vpon many by the fauoure that belonged vnto one man Iesus Christ.","16":"And the gifte is not onely ouer one synne, as death came thorow one synne of one that synned. For the iudgment came of one synne vnto condempnacion, but the gifte to iustifye fro many synnes.","17":"For yf by ye synne of one, death raigned by the meanes of one, moch more shal they which receaue the abudaunce of grace and of the gifte vnto righteousnes, raigne in life by ye meanes of one Iesus Christ.","18":"Likewyse the as by the synne of one, condemnacion came on all men, euen so also by the righteousness of one, came the iustififienge off life vpon all men.","19":"For as by the disobedience of one, many became synners, euen so by the obedience of one shal many be made righteous.","20":"But the lawe in the meane tyme entred, that synne shulde increace. Neuertheles where abundaunce of synne was, there was yet more plenteousnes of grace:","21":"that, like as synne had reigned vnto death, eue so mighte grace reigne also thorow righteousnes to euerlastinge life by the meanes of Iesus Christ."}
