They laboure all to shed bloude, & euery ma hunteth his brother to death:","3":"yet they saye they do well, when they do euell. As the prince wil, so sayeth the iudge: yt he maye do him a pleasure agayne. The greate ma speaketh what his herte desyreth, & ye hearers alowe him.","4":"The best off the is but as a thistle, and the most rightuous of them is but as a brere in the hedge But when the daye of thy preachers commeth, yt thou shalt be vysited: the shal they be waisted a waye.","5":"Let no man beleue his frende, ner put his confidece in a prince. Kepe the porte of thy mouth, from her yt lieth in thy bosome:","6":"for ye sonne shal put his father to dishonoure, the doughter shal ryse agaynst her mother, ye doughter in lawe agaynst hir mother in lawe: and a mans foes shalbe euen they of his owne housholde.","7":"Neuerthelesse I wil loke vp vnto ye LORDE, I wil paciently abyde God my sauioure: my God shal heare me.","8":"O thou enemie of myne, reioyce not at my fall, for I shal get vp agayne: and though I syt in darcknesse, yet ye LORDE is my light.","9":"I will beare the punishment of the LORDE (for why, I haue offended him) till he syt in iudgment vpon my cause, and se that I haue right. He wil bringe me forth to the light, and I shal se his rightuosnesse.","10":"She that is myne enemy shall loke vpon it, & be confounded, which now saieth: Where is thy LORDE God? Myne eyes shal beholde her, when she shalbe troden downe, as the claye in the stretes.","11":"The tyme wil come, that thy gappes shal be made vp, and the lawe shal go abrode:","12":"and at that tyme shal they come vnto the, from Assur vnto the stroge cities, and from the stronge cities vnto the ryuer: from the one see to the other, from the one mountayne to the other.","13":"Not wt stondinge the londe must be waisted, because of them that dwell therin, and for the frutes of their owne ymaginacions.","14":"Therfore fede thy people with thy rodde, the flocke of thine heretage which dwell desolate in the wodde: that they maye be fedde vpon the mount of Charmel, Basan & Galaad as afore tyme.","15":"Maruelous thinges will I shewe them, like as when they came out of Egipte.","16":"This shal the Heithen se, and be a?shamed for all their power: so that they shal laye their honde vpon their mouth, and stoppe their eares.","17":"They shal licke the dust like a serpent, & as the wormes of the earth, yt tremble in their holes.
