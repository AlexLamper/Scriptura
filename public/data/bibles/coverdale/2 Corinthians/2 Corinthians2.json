{"1":"But I determyned this wt my selfe, that I wolde not come agayne to you in heuynes.","2":"For yf I make you sory, who is it that shal make me glad, but the same which is made sory by me?","3":"And the same haue I wrytten vnto you, lest wha I come, I shulde take heuynes of them, of whom I oughte to reioyse: for somoch as I haue this confidence in you all, that my ioye is the ioye of you all.","4":"For in greate trouble and anguysh of hert wrote I vnto you with many teares: not yt ye shulde be sory, but that ye mighte perceaue the loue, which I haue most specially vnto you.","5":"But yf eny man haue caused sorowe, the same hath not made me sory, but partely, lest I shulde greue you all.","6":"It is sufficient, that the same man is so rebuked of many,","7":"so that from hence forth ye oughte the more to forgeue him and to comforte him, lest he be swalowed vp in ouer moch heuynesse.","8":"Wherfore I exhorte you, that ye shewe loue vpo him.","9":"For therfore dyd I wryte vnto you also, that I mighte knowe the profe of you, whether ye were obediet in all thinges.","10":"But loke vnto who ye forgeue eny thinge, I forgeue hi also.
