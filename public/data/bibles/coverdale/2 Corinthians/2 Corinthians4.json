{"1":"Therfore seynge we haue soch an office (euen as mercy is come vpon vs) we faynte not,","2":"but cast from vs the clokes of vnhonestye, and walke not in craftines: nether corruppe we the worde of God but open the trueth, and reporte oure selues to euery mans conscyence in the sighte of God.","3":"Yf oure Gospell be yet hyd, it is hyd in them that are lost:","4":"amonge whom the God of this worlde hath blynded ye myndes of them which beleue not, that ye lighte of the Gospell of the glory of Christ ( which is the ymage of God) shulde not shyne vnto them.","5":"For we preach not or selues, but Iesus Christ to be the LORDE, and oure selues youre seruauntes for Iesus sake.","6":"For God that comaunded the light to shyne out of darcknesse, hath geuen a cleare shyne in oure hertes, yt by vs ye light of ye knowlege of the glory of God mighte come forth, in the face of Iesus Christ.","7":"But this treasure haue we in earthen vessels, that ye power which excelleth might be of God, and not of vs.","8":"We are troubled on euery syde, yet are we not without shift. We are in pouertie, but not vtterly without somwhat.","9":"We are persecuted, but we are not forsaken.
