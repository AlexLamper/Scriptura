{"1":"The worde of the LORDE came vnto Ionas the sonne of Amithai, sayenge:","2":"Aryse, and get the to Niniue that greate cite: and preach vnto them, how yt their wickednesse is come vp before me.","3":"And Ionas made him ready to fle vnto Tharsis from the presence of the LORDE, and gat him downe to Ioppa: where he founde a shippe ready for to go vnto Tharsis. So he payde his fare, and wente aborde, that he might go with them vnto Tharsis from the presence of the LORDE.","4":"But the LORDE hurled a greate wynde in to the see, and there was a mightie tempest in the see: so that the shippe was in ioperdy of goinge in peces.","5":"Then the maryners were afrayde, and cried euery man vnto his god: and the goodes that were in the shippe, they cast in to the see, to lighten it off them. But Ionas gat him vnder ye hatches, where he layed him downe and slombred.","6":"So the master of the shippe came to him and sayde vnto him: why slomberest thou? Vp, call vpon thy God: yf God (happly) wil thynke vpon vs, that we peryshe not.","7":"And they sayde one to another: come, let vs cast lottes: that we maye knowe, for whose cause we are thus troubled. And so they cast lottes, and the lot fell vpon Ionas.","8":"The sayde they vnto him: tell vs, for whose cause are we thus troubled? what is thine occupacion? whence commest thou? what countre man art thou, and of what nacion?","9":"He answered them: I am an Ebrue, and I feare the LORDE God of heauen, which made both the see and drie londe.","10":"Then were ye men exceadingly afrayed, & sayde vnto him: why didest thou so? (for they knewe, that he was fled from the presence of the LORDE, because he had tolde them)","11":"and sayde morouer vnto him: What shall we do vnto the, that the see maye ceasse from troublinge vs? (for the see wrought and was troublous)","12":"he answered them: Take me, and cast me in to the see, so shal it let you be in rest: for I wote, it is for my sake, that this greate tempest is come vpon you.","13":"Neuerthelesse, the men assayed with rowinge, to brynge the shippe to lode: but it wolde not be, because the see wrought so, & was so troublous agaynst them.","14":"Wherfore they cried vnto the LORDE, and sayde: O LORDE, let vs not perish for this mans death, nether laye thou innocent bloude vnto oure charge: for thou (o LORDE) hast done, euen as thy pleasure was.","15":"So they toke Ionas, and cast him in to the see, and the see lefte ragynge.","16":"And the men feared the LORDE exceadingly, doynge sacrifices ad makynge vowes vnto the LORDE.","17":"Bvt the LORDE prepared a greate fyshe, to swalow vp Ionas. So was Ionas in the bely of the fysh, thre dayes and thre nightes."}
