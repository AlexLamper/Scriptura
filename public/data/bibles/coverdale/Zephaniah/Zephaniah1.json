{"1":"This is the worde of the LORDE, which came vnto Sophony the sonne of Chusi, the sonne of Gedolias, the sonne of Amarias ye sonne of Hezechias: in the tyme of Iosias the sonne of Amon kinge of Iuda.","2":"I will gather vp all thinges in the londe (saieth the LORDE)","3":"I wil gather vp man and beest: I wil gather vp the foules in the ayre, and the fysh in the see (to the greate decaye of the wicked) & wil vtterly destroye the men out of the londe, saieth the LORDE.","4":"I wil stretch out myne honde vpon Iuda, and vpon all soch as dwel at Ierusalem. Thus wil I rote out the remnaunt of Baal from this place, and the names of the Kemuryns and prestes:","5":"yee & soch as vpon their house toppes worshipe & bowe them selues vnto the hoost of heauen: which sweare by the LORDE, and by their Malchom also:","6":"which starte a backe from ye LORDE, and nether seke after the LORDE, ner regarde him.","7":"Be still at ye presence of the LORDE God, for the daye of the LORDE is at honde: yee the LORDE hath prepared a slayne offeringe, and called his gestes therto.","8":"And thus shall it happen in the daye of the LORDES a slaynofferynge: I will vyset the prynces, the kinges children, & all soch as weere strauge clothinge.","9":"In the same daye also wil I vyset all those, that treade ouer the thresholde so proudly, which fyll their lordes house wt robbery and falsede.","10":"At ye same tyme (saieth the LORDE) there shall be herde a greate crie from the fyshporte, and an howlinge from ye other porte, and a greate murthur from the hilles.","11":"Howle ye that dwel in the myll, for all the marchaunt people are gone, and all they that were laden with syluer, are roted out.","12":"At the same tyme wil I seke thorow Ierusalem with lanternes, and vyset them that contynue in their dregges, and saye in their hertes: Tush, the LORDE wil do nether good ner euell.","13":"Their goodes shalbe spoyled, and their houses layed waist.
