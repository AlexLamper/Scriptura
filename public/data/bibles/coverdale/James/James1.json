{"1":"Iames the seruaunt of God and of the LORDE Iesus Christ, sendeth gretinge to the xij. trybes which are scatered here & there.","2":"My brethren, counte it exceadynge ioye whe ye fall in to diuers temptacions,","3":"for as moche as ye knowe, how yt the tryinge of youre faith bringeth pacience:","4":"and let pacience haue her parfect worke, yt ye maye be parfecte aud sounde, lakinge nothinge.","5":"Yf eny of you lacke wyssdome, let him axe of God, which geueth to all men indifferentlie, and casteth no man in the teth: and it shal be geue him.","6":"But let him axe in faith and wauer not. For he that douteth, is lyke the wawes of ye See, tost of the wynde, and caried wt violence.","7":"Nether let yt man thinke that he shal receaue eny thige of ye LORDE.","8":"A wauerynge mynded ma ys vnstable in all his waies.","9":"Let the brother of lowe degre reioyce, in yt he is exalted:","10":"and the rich, in yt he is made lowe. For eue as the flor of ye grasse shal he vanyshe awaye.","11":"The Sonne ryseth wt heat and the grasse wydereth, & his floure falleth awaye, and the beautie of the fassion of it perissheth: euen so shal the ryche man perisshe with his abundaunce.","12":"Happy is the man that endureth in teptacion, for when he is tryed, he shal receaue the crowne of life, which the LORDE hath promised to them that loue him.","13":"Let no man saye when he is tempted, yt he is tempted of God. For God tepteth not vnto euell, nether tepteth he eny man.","14":"But euery ma is tepted, drawne awaye, & entysed of his awne cocupiscece.","15":"The whe lust hath conceaued, she bringeth forth synne, & synne when it is fynished, bringeth forth deeth.","16":"Erre not my deare brethre.","17":"Euery good gifte, & euery parfait gift, is from aboue, and cometh downe from ye father of light, with whom is no variablenes, nether is he chaunged vnto darcknes.","18":"Of his awne will begat he vs with the worde of life, that we shulde be the fyrst frutes of his creatures.","19":"Wherfore deare brethren, let euery man be swifte to heare, slowe to speake, and slowe to wrath.","20":"For the wrath of ma worketh not that which is righteous before God.","21":"Wherfore laye aparte all fylthines, all superfluite of maliciousnes, & receaue with meknes ye worde yt is grafted in you, which is able to saue youre soules.","22":"And se that ye be doers of ye worde & not heares only, deceauinge youre awne selues.","23":"For yf eny heare the worde, and do it not, he is like vnto a ma that beholdeth his bodily face in a glasse.","24":"For assone as he hath loked on himselfe, he goeth his waye, and forgetteth immediatly what his fasshion was.","25":"But who so loketh in ye perfect lawe of libertie, and continueth therin (yf he be not a forgetfull hearer, but a doar of the worke) the same shalbe happie in his dede.","26":"Yf eny man amonge you seme deuoute, & refrayne not his toge: but deceaue his awne herte, this mannes deuocion is in vayne.","27":"Pure deuocion and vndefiled before God the father, is this: to visit the frendlesse and widdowes in their aduersite, and to kepe him selfe vnspotted of the worlde."}
