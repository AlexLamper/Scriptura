{"1":"And it fortuned afterwarde, that he wente thorow the cities and townes, and preached, and shewed ye Gospell of the kyngdome of God, and the twolue wt him.","2":"And certayne wemen also, who he had healed fro euell spretes and infirmities: Namely, Mary which is called Magdalene, out of whom wente seuen deuels,","3":"and Ioanna ye wife of Chusa Herodes stewarde, and Susanna, and many other, that mynistred vnto them of their substaunce.","4":"Now wha moch people were gathered together, and haisted vnto him out of the cities, He spake by a symilitude:","5":"There wente out a sower to sowe his sede, & whyle he was sowynge, some fell by the waye syde, and was trodde vnder fote, and the foules of the ayre ate it vp.","6":"And some fell on stone, and whan it was spronge vp, it wythred awaye, because it had no moystnesse.","7":"And some fell amonge thornes, and the thornes sprange vp with it, and choked it.","8":"And some fell vpo a good grounde, and sprange vp, and bare frute an hundreth folde. Wha he sayde this he cryed: Who so hath eares to heare, let him heare.","9":"And his disciples axed him, and sayde: What symilitude is this?","10":"And he sayde: Vnto you it is geue, to knowe the mysteryes of the kyngdome of God, but vnto the other in parables, yt though they se it, they shulde not se it, and though they heare it, they shulde not vnderstonde.","11":"This is the parable: The sede is the worde of God:","12":"As for those that are by ye waye syde, they are they that heare it, afterwarde commeth the deuell, and taketh awaye the worde out of their hertes, that they shulde not beleue, and be saued.","13":"But they on ye stone, are soch as whan they heare it, receaue the worde with ioye, and these haue no rote: they beleue for a whyle, and in the tyme of temptacion they fall awaye.","14":"As for it that fel amonge the thornes, are soch as heare it, and go forth amonge the cares, riches and volupteousnesses of this life, and are choked and brynge forth no frute.","15":"But that on the good grounde, are they that heare the worde, and kepe it in a pure good hert, and brynge forth frute in pacience.","16":"No man lighteth a cadell, and couereth it with a vessell, or putteth it vnder a table, but setteth it vpon a candelsticke, that soch as go in maye se light.","17":"For there is nothinge hyd, that shal not be openly shewed: and there is nothinge secrete, that shal not be knowne, and come to light.","18":"Take hede therfore how ye heare. For who so hath, vnto him shalbe geue: but who so hath not, from him shalbe taken awaye, eue the same that he thynketh to haue.","19":"There wente vnto him his mother and his brethren, and coude not come at him for the people.","20":"And it was tolde him. Thy mother and thy brethren stonde without, and wolde se the.","21":"But he answered, & sayde vnto the: My mother and my brethren are these, which heare the worde of God, and do it.","22":"And it fortuned vpon a certayne daye, yt he wente in to a shippe, and his disciples wt him, & he sayde vnto the: Let vs passe ouer to the other syde of ye lake. And they thurst of fro the lode.","23":"And as they sayled, he slepte. And there came a storme of wynde vpon ye lake, and the wawes fell vpon the, and they stode in greate ioperdy.","24":"Then wete they vnto him, and waked him vp, & sayde: Master master, we perishe. Then he arose, and rebuked the wynde, and the tepest of water, and they ceassed, and it waxed calme.","25":"But he sayde vnto the: Where is youre faith? Neuertheles they were afrayed, and wodred, and sayde one to another: What is he this? For he comaundeth the wyndes and the water, and they are obedient vnto him.","26":"And they sayled forth in to the countre of the Gadarenites, which is ouer agaynst Galile.","27":"And whan he wente out to londe, there met him out of ye cite a ma, which had a deuell longe tyme, & ware no clothes, & taried in no house, but in the graues.","28":"Neuertheles wha he sawe Iesus, he cried, and fell downe before him, and cried loude, & sayde: What haue I to do with the Iesus, thou sonne of the Hyest God? I beseke the, that thou wilt not tormete me.","29":"For he comaunded the foule sprete, that he shulde departe out of the ma, for he had plaged hi a loge season. And he was bounde with cheynes, and kepte wt fetters, and he brake the bondes in sonder, and was caried of the deuell in to the wyldernesse.","30":"And Iesus axed him, and sayde: What is thy name? He sayde: Legion. For there were many deuels entred in to him.","31":"And they besought him, that he wolde not comaunde the to go in to the depe.","32":"But there was there a greate heerd of swyne fedynge vpon the mountayne, and they besought him, that he wolde geue them leue, to entre in to ye same. And he gaue the leue.","33":"Then departed ye deuels out of the ma, and entred into the swyne. And the heerd russhed headlynges with a storme in to the lake, and were drowned.","34":"But wha ye herdmen sawe what had chaunsed, they fled, and tolde it in the cite and in the vyllagies.","35":"Then wente they out, for to se what was done, and came to Iesus, and founde the ma (out of whom the deuyls were departed) syttinge at Iesus fete, clothed, and in his right mynde, and they were afrayed.","36":"And they yt had sene it, tolde the how the possessed was healed.","37":"And the whole multitude of ye countre of the Gadarenites besought him, that he wolde departe from them, for there was a greate feare come vpon the. And he gat him in to ye shippe, and turned agayne.","38":"And the man out of who the deuels were departed, besought him, yt he might be with him. But Iesus sent him awaye, and sayde:","39":"Go home agayne, and shewe how greate thinges God hath done for the. And he wente his waye, & preached thorow out all ye cite, how greate thinges Iesus had done for hi.","40":"And it fortuned wha Iesus came agayne, the people receaued him, for they wayted for him.","41":"And beholde, there came a man named Iairus (and he was a ruler of the synagoge) and fell at Iesus fete, & besought him, that he wolde come in to his house.","42":"For he had but one doughter (vpon a twolue yeare of age) and she laye at ye poynt of death. And as he wente, the people thronged him.","43":"And a woma hauynge the bloudyssue twolue yeares, (which had spent all hir substaunte vpon phisicians, and coude be healed of none)","44":"came behynde, & touched the hemme of his garmet, and immediatly hir yssue of bloude was staunched.","45":"And Iesus sayde: Who hath touched me? But whan they all denyed, Peter sayde, and they that were with him: Master, the people thronge the and thrust the, and thou sayest: Who hath touched me?","46":"Iesus saide: Some body hath touched me, for I fele, that there is vertue gone out fro me.","47":"But whan the woman sawe that she was not hyd, she came treblynge, and fell downe before him, and tolde him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, & how she was healed immediatly.","48":"And he sayde vnto her: Doughter, be of good comforte, thy faith hath made the whole, go thy waye in peace.","49":"Whyle he yet spake, there came one fro ye ruler of ye synagoges house, and sayde vnto him: Thy doughter is deed, disease not the master.","50":"Whan Iesus herde that, he answered him, and sayde: Feare not, beleue onely, and she shal be made whole.","51":"But whan he came in to the house, he suffred no man to go in, saue Peter, and Iames and Iho, and the father and mother of the mayden.","52":"They wepte all, and sorowed for her. But he sayde: Wepe not, for she is not deed, but slepeth.","53":"And they laughed hi to scorne, knowynge well that she was deed.","54":"But he thrust them all out, and toke her by the hande, and cryed, and sayde: Mayde aryse.","55":"And hir sprete came agayne, & she arose straight waye. And he comaunded to geue her meate.","56":"And hir elders were astonnyed. But he charged them, that they shulde tell no man, what was done."}
