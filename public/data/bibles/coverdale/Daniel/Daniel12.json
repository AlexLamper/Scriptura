{"1":"The tyme wil come also, that the greate prynce Michael, which stondeth on thy peoples syde, shal aryse vp, for there shal come a tyme of trouble, soch as neuer was, sens there begane to be eny people, vnto that same tyme. Then shal thy people be delyuered, yee all those that be foude written in the boke.","2":"Many of them that slepe in the dust of the earth, shal awake: some to euerlastinge life, some to perpetuall shame & reprofe.","3":"The wyse (soch as haue taught other) shal glister, as the shyninge of heauen: and those that haue instructe the multitude vnto godlynesse, shalbe as the starres, worlde without ende.","4":"And thou o Daniel, shut vp these wordes, & seale the boke, till the last tyme. Many shal go aboute here and there, and the shal knowlege increase.","5":"So I Daniel loked, and beholde, there stode other two: one vpon this shore of the water, the other vpon yonder syde.","6":"And one of the sayde vnto him, which was clothed in lynnynge, and stode aboue vpon the waters of the floude: How longe shall it be to the ende of these wonderous workes?","7":"Then herde I the man with the lynnynge clothes, which stode aboue vpon the waters of the floude: when he helde vp his right and left honde vnto heauen, & sware by him which lyueth for euer: that it shal tary for a tyme, two tymes & half a tyme: & when the power of the holy people is clene scatred abrode, the shal all these thinges be fulfilled.","8":"I herde it well, but I vnderstode it not. Then sayde I: O my lorde, what shal happen after that?","9":"He answered: Go thy waye Daniel, for these wordes shal be closed vp & sealed, till the last tyme:","10":"& many shalbe purified, clensed & tried. But the vngodly shall lyue wickedly, and those wicked (as many of the as they be) shal haue no vnderstondinge. As for soch as haue vnderstondinge, they shal regarde it.","11":"And from ye tyme forth that the daylie offerynge shalbe put downe & the abhominable desolacion set vp, there shalbe a thousande two hudreth & xc.dayes.","12":"O well is him, that waiteth, & commeth to the thousande iij.C. & xxxv.dayes.","13":"Go thou thy waye now, till it be ended: take thy rest, and byde in thy lot, till the dayes haue an ende."}
