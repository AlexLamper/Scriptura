{"1":"Eliu spake morouer, and sayde:","2":"Thinkest thou it right that thou sayest: I am rightuous before God","3":"Seinge thou sayest so, how doest thou knowe it? What thinge hast thou more excellet, the I yt am a synner?","4":"Therfore will I geue answere vnto the & thy frendes:","5":"loke vnto the heaue, & beholde it: cosidre ye cloudes, how they are hyer then thou.","6":"Yf thou synnest, what dost thou vnto him? Yf thine offences be many, how gettest thou his fauoure?","7":"Yf thou be rightuous, what geuest thou him? Or, what receaueth he of thy handes?","8":"Of soch an vngodly personne as thou, & of ye sonne of man that is rightuous as thou pretendest to be:","9":"there is a greate crie & coplaynte made by the that are oppressed with violence, yee eueryman complayneth vpon the cruell arme of tyrauntes.","10":"For soch one neuer sayeth: Where is God that made me? ad yt shyneth vpon vs, that we might prayse him in the night?","11":"Which geueth vs more vnderstodinge then he doth the beastes of the earth, and teacheth vs more then the foules off heaue.","12":"Yf eny soch complayne, no ma geueth answere, and yt because of the wickednesse off proude tyrauntes.","13":"But yf a man call vpon God, doth not he heare him? Doth not the Almightie accepte his crie?","14":"Wha thou speakest then, shulde not he pardon the, yff thou open thyself before him, and put thy trust in him?","15":"Then vseth he no violence in his wrath nether hath he pleasure in curious and depe inquisicions.","16":"Therfore hath Iob opened his mouth but in vayne, ad folishly hath he made so many wordes."}
