{"1":"Then answered Baldad the Suhite, & sayde:","2":"Power & feare is with him aboue, that maketh peace (sittinge) in his hynesse,","3":"whose men of warre are innumerable, and whose light aryseth ouer all.","4":"But how maye a man copared vnto God, be iustified? Or, how can he be clene, that is borne of a woman?","5":"Beholde, the Moone shyneth nothinge in comparison to him, & the starres are vnclene in his sight.","6":"How moch more the, ma, that is but corrupcion: and the sonne of man, which is but a worme?"}
