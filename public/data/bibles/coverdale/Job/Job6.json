{"1":"Iob answered, and sayde:","2":"O that my misery weere weyed, and my punyshment layed in the balaunces:","3":"for then shulde it be heuyer, then the sonde of the see. This is the cause, that my wordes are so soroufull.","4":"For the allmighty hath shott at me with his arowes, whose indignacion hath droncke vp my sprete, and ye terrible feares of God fight agaysnt me.","5":"Doth the wilde asse roare when he hath grasse? Or crieth the oxe, whe he hath fodder ynough?","6":"Maye a thynge be eaten vnseasoned, or without salt? What taist hath ye whyte within the yoke an egg?","7":"The thinges that sometyme I might not awaye withall, are now my meate for very sorow.","8":"O that I might haue my desyre: O yt God wolde graunte me the thynge, that I longe for:","9":"That he wolde begynne and smyte me: that he wolde let his honde go, & hew me downe.","10":"The shulde I haue some coforte: yee I wolde desyre him in my payne, that he shulde not spare, for I will not be agaynst ye wordes of the holy one.","11":"What power haue I to endure? Or? what is myne ende, that my soule might be paciet?","12":"Is my strength the strength of stones? Or, is my flesh made of brasse?","13":"Am I able to helpe my self? Is not my strength gone fro me,","14":"like as yf one withdrewe a good dede from his frende, and forsoke the feare of God?","15":"Myne owne brethren passe ouer by me as the waterbroke, that hastely runneth thorow ye valleys.","16":"But they that feare the horefrost, the snowe shal fall vpon them.","17":"When their tyme cometh, they shalbe destroyed and perishe: and when they be set on fyre, they shalbe remoued out of their place,","18":"for the pathes yt they go in, are croked: they haist after vayne thinges, and shal perish.","19":"Considre the pathes off Theman, & the wayes off Saba, wherin they haue put their trust.","20":"Confounded are they, that put eny cofidence in them: For whe they came to opteyne the thynges that they loked for, they were brought to confucion.","21":"Eue so are ye also come vnto me: but now that ye se my mysery, ye are afrayed.","22":"Dyd I desyre you, to come hyther? Or, to geue me eny off youre substaunce?","23":"To delyuer me me from the enemies honde, or to saue me from the powers off the mightie?","24":"Teach me and I will holde my tonge: and yf I do erre, shewe me wherin.","25":"Wherfore blame ye then the wordes, that are well and truly spoken?","26":"which of you can reproue them? Sauynge only that ye are sotyll to check mens sayenges, and can speake many wordes in the wynde.","27":"Ye fall vpon the fatherlesse, ad go aboute to ouerthrowe youre owne frende.","28":"Wherfore loke not only vpon me, but vpon youre selues: whether I lye, or no.","29":"Turne into youre owne selues (I praye you) be indifferent iudges, and considre myne vngyltinesse:","30":"whether there be eny vnrightuousnesse in my tonge, or vayne wordes in my mouth."}
