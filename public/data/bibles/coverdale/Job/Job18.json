Marcke well, and considre, we wil speake also.","3":"Wherfore are we counted as beestes, & reputed so vyle in youre sight?","4":"Why destroyest thou thy self with anger? Shal ye earth be forsaken, or the stones remoued out of their place because of ye?","5":"Shal not the light of the vngodly be put out? yee the flame of his fyre shal not burne.","6":"The light shalbe darcke in his dwellinge, & his candle shalbe put out with him.","7":"His presumptuous goinges shal be kepte in, and his owne councell shal cast him downe.","8":"For his fete shalbe taken in the nett, and he shal walke in the snare.","9":"His fote shalbe holden in the gilder, and the thurstie shal catch him.","10":"The snare is layed for him in the grounde, and a pytfall in the waye.","11":"Fearfulnesse shal make him afrayed on euery syde, that he shall not knowe, where to get out.","12":"Honger shalbe his substaunce, and my?fortune shall hange vpon him.","13":"He shall eate his owne skynne, yee his owne armes shall he deuoure, beynge a firstborne of death.","14":"All his comforte and hope shalbe roted out of his dwellynge, very fearfulnesse shall brynge him to the kynge.","15":"Other men shall dwel in his house (which now is none of his) and brymstone shalbe scatered vpon his habitacion.","16":"His rotes shalbe dryed vp beneth, & aboue shall his haruest be cut downe.","17":"His remembraunce shall perish from the earth, & his name shall not be praysed in the stretes:","18":"he shalbe dryuen from the light into darcknesse, and be cast clene out of the worlde.","19":"He shall nether haue children ner kyn?folkes amonge his people, no ner eny posterite in his countre:","20":"yonge & olde shalbe astonyshed at his death.","21":"Soch are now the dwellynges of the wicked, and this is ye place of him that knoweth not God."}
