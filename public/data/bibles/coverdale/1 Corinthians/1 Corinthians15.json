{"1":"I declare vnto you brethren, the Gospell that I haue preached vnto you (which ye haue also accepted, and in the which ye stode,","2":"by the which also ye are saued) after what maner I preached it vnto you, yf ye haue kepte it, excepte ye haue beleued in vayne.","3":"For first of all I delyuered vnto you that which I also receaued, how that Christ dyed for oure synnes acordinge to the scriptures,","4":"and that he was buried, and that he rose agayne ye thirde daye acordinge to the scriptures,","5":"and that he was sene of Cephas, then of the twolue:","6":"after that was he sene of mo then fyue hundreth brethren at once, wherof there are yet many alyue, but some are fallen aslepe.","7":"Afterwarde was he sene of Iames, then of all the Apostles.","8":"Last of all was he sene of me also, as of one borne out of due tyme.","9":"For I am ye leest of the Apostles, which am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the congregacion of God.","10":"But by the grace of God I am that I am. And his grace in me hath not bene vayne, but I haue laboured more then they all: howbeit not I but the grace of God which is wt me.","11":"Now whether it be I or they, thus haue we preached, and thus haue ye beleued.","12":"But yf Christ be preached, that he is rysen from the deed, how saye then some amoge you, that there is no resurreccion of the deed?","13":"Yf there be no resurreccio of the deed, then is Christ not rysen.","14":"Yf Christ be not rysen, then is oure preachinge in vayne,and youre faith is also in vayne:","15":"yee and we are founde false witnesses of God, because we haue testified agaynst God, that he hath raysed vp Christ, whom he hath not raysed vp, yf the deed ryse not agayne.","16":"For yf the deed ryse not agayne, the is Christ also not rysen agayne.","17":"But yf Christ be not rysen agayne, then is youre faith in vayne, and ye are yet in youre synnes:","18":"they also that are falle a slepe in Christ, are perished.","19":"Yf in this life onely we hope on Christ, then are we of all men the most miserable.","20":"But now is Christ rysen from the deed, and is become ye first frutes of them that slepe.","21":"For by one man commeth death, and by one man the resurreccion of the deed.","22":"For as they all dye in Adam, so shal they all be made alyue in Christ,","23":"but euery one in his order. The first is Christ, then they that beloge vnto Christ, whan he commeth.","24":"Then the ende, wha he shal delyuer vp the kyngdome vnto God the father, whan he shal put downe all rule, and all superiorite, & power.","25":"For he must raygne, tyll he haue put all his enemies vnder his fete.","26":"The last enemye that shal be destroyed, is death,","27":"for he hath put all thinges vnder his fete. But wha he sayeth, that all thinges are put vnder him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which put all thinges vnder him.","28":"Whan all thinges shalbe subdued vnto him, then shal the sonne himselfe also be subiecte vnto him, which put all thinges vnder him, that God maye be all in all.","29":"Or els what do they which are baptised ouer ye deed, yf the deed ryse not at all? Why are they then baptysed ouer the deed?","30":"And why stonde we in ioperdy euery houre?","31":"By oure reioysinge which I haue in Christ Iesu or LORDE, I dye daylie.","32":"That I haue foughte with beestes at Ephesus after ye maner of men, what helpeth it me, yf the deed ryse not agayne? Let vs eate and drynke, for tomorow we shal dye.","33":"Be not ye disceaued. Euell speakinges corruppe good maners.","34":"Awake righte vp, and synne not: for some haue not ye knowlege of God. This I saye to youre shame.","35":"But some man mighte saye: How shal the deed aryse? And with what maner off body shal they come?","36":"Thou foole, yt which thou sowest is not quyckened, excepte it dye.","37":"And what sowest thou? thou sowest not ye body that shalbe, but a bare corne, namely of wheate, or of some other.","38":"But God geueth it a body as he wil, and vnto euery one of ye sedes his owne body.","39":"All flesshe is not one maner of flesshe, but there is one maner flesshe of men, another of beastes, another of fisshes, another of byrdes.","40":"And there are heauenly bodies, and there are earthy bodies: but the heauenly haue one glory, and ye earthy another.","41":"The Sonne hath one clearnes, the Moone hath another clearnesse, and the starres haue another clearnesse, for one starre excelleth another in clearnesse:","42":"Euen so the resurreccion of the deed. It is sowne in corrupcion,and shal ryse in vncorrupcion:","43":"It is sowne in dishonoure, & shal ryse in glory:It is sowne in weaknesse, and shal ryse in power: It is sowne a naturall body, & shal ryse a spirituall body.","44":"Yf there be a naturall body, there is a spirituall body also.","45":"As it is wrytten: The first man Adam was made in to a naturall life, and the last Ada in to a spiritual life.","46":"Howbeit the spirituall body is not the first, but ye naturall, and then the spirituall.","47":"The first man is of the earth, earthy: ye seconde ma is fro heaue, heauely.","48":"As the earthy is, soch are they also that are earthy: and as ye heauenly is, soch are they also yt are heauenly.","49":"And as we haue borne the ymage of the earthy, so shal we beare the ymage of the heauenly also.","50":"This I saye brethren, that flesh & bloude can not inheret ye kyngdome of God: nether shal corrupcion inheret vncorrupcion.","51":"Beholde, I saye vnto you a mystery: We shal not all slepe, but we shall all be chaunged,","52":"and that sodenly and in the twinklynge of an eye, at the tyme of the last trompe. For the trompe shal blowe, and the deed shal ryse vncorruptible, and we shalbe chaunged.","53":"For this corruptible must put on vncorrupcion, and this mortall must put on immortalite.","54":"But whan this corruptible shal put on vncorrupcion, and this mortall shal put on immortalite, the shal the worde be fulfylled that is wrytte:","55":"Death is swalowed vp in victory. Death, where is thy stynge? Hell, where is yi victory?","56":"The stynge of death is synne: The strength of synne is the lawe.","57":"But thankes be vnto God, which hath geue vs the victory thorow oure LORDE Iesus Christ.","58":"Therfore my deare brethre, be ye stedfast, vnmoueable, & all waye riche in the worke of the LORDE, for as moch as ye knowe, that youre laboure is not in vayne in the LORDE."}
