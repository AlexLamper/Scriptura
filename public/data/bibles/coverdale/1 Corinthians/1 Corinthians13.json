{"1":"Though I spake with the tunges of men and angels, and yet had not loue, I were euen as sowndinge brasse, or as a tynklinge Cymball.","2":"And though I coulde prophecy, & vnderstode all secretes, and all knowlege, and had all faith, so that I coulde moue moutaynes out of their places, and yet had not loue, I were nothinge.","3":"And though I bestowed all my goodes to fede ye poore, and though I gaue my body euen that I burned, and yet haue not loue, it profiteth me nothinge.","4":"Loue is pacient & curteous, loue envyeth not, loue doth not frowardly, is not puft vp, dealeth not dishonestly,","5":"seketh not hir awne, is not prouoked vnto anger, thynketh not euell,","6":"reioyseth not ouer iniquyte, but reioyseth in the trueth,","7":"beareth all thinges, beleueth all thinges, hopeth all thinges, suffreth all thinges.","8":"Though prophecienges fayle, or tunges ceasse, or knowlege perishe, yet loue falleth neuer awaye.","9":"For oure knowlege is vnparfecte, and oure prophecienge is vnparfecte.","10":"But wha that which is perfecte, commeth, then shal the vnparfecte be done awaye.","11":"Whan I was a childe, I spake as a childe, I vnderstode as a childe, I ymagined as a childe. But as soone as I was a man, I put awaye childishnes.","12":"Now we se thorow a glasse in a darke speakynge, but the shal we se face to face. Now I knowe vnperfectly: but the shal I knowe eue as I am knowne.","13":"Now abydeth faith, hope, loue, these thre: but the greatest of these is loue."}
