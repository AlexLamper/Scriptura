{"1":"I commende you","2":"brethren, that ye remembre me in all poyntes, and kepe the ordinaunces, eue as I delyuered them vnto you.","3":"But I certifye you, that Christ is the heade of euery man. As for ye man, he is the heade of ye woman, but God is Christes heade.","4":"Euery man that prayeth or prophecieth, and hath eny thinge on his heade, shameth his heade.","5":"But euery woman that prayeth or prophecieth with vncouered heade, dishonesteth hir heade. For it is euen a lyke moch as yf she were shauen.","6":"Yf the woma be not couered, let hir heer also be cut of. But yf it be vncomely for a woman to haue hir heer cut of or to be shauen, then let hir couer hir heade.","7":"Neuertheles the man oughte not to couer his heade, for so moch as he is the ymage and glory of God: but the woma is the glory of the man.","8":"For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.","9":"Nether was the man created for the womans sake, but the woma for the mans sake.","10":"Therfore ought the woman to haue a power vpon hir heade, for the angels sakes.","11":"Neuertheles nether is the man without ye woman, nether the woman without the ma in the LORDE.","12":"For as the woman is of the man, euen so commeth the man also by the woman, but all of God.","13":"Iudge ye by yor selues, whether it be comly, yt a woma praye before God bare headed?","14":"Or doth not nature teach you, yt it is a shame for a man","15":"yf he weere loge heer, & a prayse to ye woma, yf she weere loge heer? For hir heer is geue heer to couer her withall.","16":"But yf there be eny man amoge you that hath lust to stryue, let him knowe, that we haue no soch custome, nether the congregacions of God.","17":"But this must I warne you of: I commende it not, that ye come together not after a better maner but after a worse.","18":"First, whan ye come together in the congregacion, I heare, that there are discensions amonge you, and I partly beleue it.","19":"For there must be sectes amonge you, that they which are perfecte amonge you, mighte be knowne.","20":"Now whan ye come together, the LORDES supper can not be kepte. For whan it shulde be kepte, euery ma taketh his awne supper afore.","21":"And one is hogrie, another is dronke. Haue ye not houses to eate and drynke in?","22":"Or despyse ye ye cogregacion of God, and shame them that haue not? What shal I saye vnto you? Shal I prayse you? in this prayse I you not.","23":"That which I delyuered vnto you, receaued I of the LORDE. For the LORDE Iesus the same nighte in the which he was betrayed, toke the bred,","24":"& gaue thankes, and brake it, and sayde: Take ye, & eate ye, this is my body, which is broken for you. This do in the remembraunce of me.","25":"After the same maner also he toke ye cuppe whan supper was done, and sayde: This cuppe is the new Testament in my bloude, this do (as oft as ye drynke it) in the remebrauce of me.","26":"For as oft as ye shal eate of this bred, & drynke of this cuppe, ye shal shewe the LORDES death, vntyll he come.","27":"Wherfore who soeuer shal eate off this bred, and drynke off this cuppe of the LORDE vnworthely, shalbe giltye of the body and bloude of the LORDE.","28":"But let a man examen himselfe, and so let him eate of this bred, and drynke of this cuppe.","29":"For he that eateth and drynketh vnworthely, eateth & drynketh his awne damnacion, because he maketh no differece of the LORDES body.","30":"Therfore are there so many weake and sicke amoge you, and many slepe.","31":"For yf we iudged oure selues, we shulde not be iudged.","32":"But whan we are iudged, we are chastened of ye LORDE, that we shulde not be daned with the worlde.","33":"Wherfore my brethren, whan ye come together to eate, tary one for another.","34":"But yf eny man honger, let him eate at home, that ye come not together vnto codempnacion. As for other thinges, I wil set them in order whan I come."}
