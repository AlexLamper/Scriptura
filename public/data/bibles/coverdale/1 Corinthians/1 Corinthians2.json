{"1":"And I brethre, wha I came vnto you came not wt hye wordes or hye wyssdome, to shewe vnto you the preachinge of Christ.","2":"For I shewed not forth my selfe amonge you that I knewe eny thinge, saue onely Iesus Christ, euen the sam thate was crucified.","3":"And I was amonge you in weaknes, and in feare, and in moch tremblinge:","4":"and my worde and my preachinge was not with entysinge wordes of mans wyssdome, but in shewinge of the sprete and of power:","5":"that youre faith shulde not stonde in the wyssdome of men, but in the power of God.","6":"That we speake of, is wyssdome amonge the yt are perfecte: not ye wyssdome of this worlde, nether of the rulers of this worlde which go to naughte:","7":"but we speake of the wyssdome of God, which is in secrete and lyeth hyd: which God ordeyned before the worlde vnto oure glorye:","8":"which none of ye rulers of this worlde knewe. For yf they had knowne it, they had not crucified the LORDE of glorye,","9":"but as it is wrytten: The eye hath not sene, and the eare hath not herde, nether hath it entred in to the hert of man that God hath prepared for them that loue him.","10":"But God hath opened it vnto vs by his sprete. For the sprete searcheth out all thinges, yee euen the depenesses of the God heade.","11":"For what ma knoweth what is in man, saue the sprete of ma which is in him? Euen so no man knoweth what is in God, saue ye sprete of God.","12":"As for vs, we haue not receaued the sprete of this worlde, but the sprete which cometh of God, so that we ca knowe what is geue vs of God:","13":"which we also speake, not with connynge wordes of mas wyssdome, but with the conynge wordes of the holy goost, and iudge spirituall matters spiritually.","14":"Howbeit the naturall man perceaueth nothinge of ye sprete of God. It is foolishnes vnto him, and he can not perceaue it: for it must be spiritually discerned.","15":"But he that is spirituall, discusseth all thinges, and he is iudged of no man.","16":"For who hath knowne ye mynde of the LORDE? Or who shal enfourme him? But we haue the mynde of Christ."}
